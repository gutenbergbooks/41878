PREFACE
</h3>

<p>
Our interest in China was first aroused by a letter
from an old school-fellow, Arthur Polhill, who, with
heroic self-denial, has spent the best part of his life
in China as a missionary.  Subsequently I joined the
China Emergency Committee, who in 1907 invited us
to go out to the Shanghai Centenary Conference.
That visit led naturally to a tour in China, Korea,
and Japan.  When we returned we found that great
interest was being felt at the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge in the movement in the Far East; a
Committee was formed to study the whole question,
which accepted provisionally the idea of encouraging
the foundation of a Western University.  Before finally
accepting the idea it was felt that some one ought to
go to the mission centres of China and find out the
opinions of the missionaries working on the field,
and at the same time sound the Chinese Government
and see whether it would be favourable to the
scheme.  As a result of these deliberations, the
Committee asked us in 1909 to go out again, this time
on behalf of the United Universities Scheme.  On our
return it was suggested that if we put our report
into the form of a book it might possibly excite
interest in the whole question, especially in the
University scheme.  We were deeply impressed with
two great facts&mdash;the greatness of the need of Western
education from a Christian standpoint and the vital
importance of immediate action.

<p>
Not only did we seek information from English
and American but also from French and Italian
missions as occasion offered.  We tested and
compared this information by the information we got
from that most enlightened and able body of men
who form the consular body in China.  We are
especially grateful to Sir John Jordan, by whose
great diplomatic skill both the position of England
and the goodwill of the Chinese are maintained.
</p>

<p>
It would be impossible even to record the names
of all with whom we conversed, but our thanks are
especially due to the following friends, not only for
their generous hospitality, but also for the patient
and kind way in which they instructed us in the
many difficult aspects of the Chinese problem:&mdash;

CHINA IN TRANSITION
</h2>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<h4>
WHAT HAS AWAKENED CHINA?
</h4>

<p>
For centuries China has been the land that never
moved.  It had a political history full of wars and
bloodshed, of intrigue and murder; periods of
prosperity and enlightenment; periods of darkness and
desolation; but the country remained essentially the
same country.  There might be some small alteration
in its customs, but China was distinctly unprogressive.
And everybody who knew China ten or fifteen years
ago was prepared to prophesy that it would continue
to remain unprogressive.
</p>

<p>
Many a missionary speaks of the China that he
used to know as a very different land from the China
of to-day.  It used to be a sort of Rip Van Winkle
land that had slept a thousand years, and showed
every sign of remaining asleep for another thousand.
Mrs. Arnold Foster told us that when she first
came to Wuchang she used to see the soldiers
dressed mediævally, learning to make faces to inspire
terror in the hearts of the adversary.  Monseigneur
Jarlin, the head of the French mission in Peking,
described the China of olden times by saying that
in his young days all Chinamen had a rooted
contempt for everything Western.  Theirs was the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
only civilised land.  The West was the land of
barbarism.  Now, he added, the positions are reversed;
every Chinaman despises China, and is convinced that
from the West comes the light of civilisation.
Arch-deacon Moule tells how he sailed out to China in a
sailing ship, and found a land absolutely indifferent
to the existence of the West&mdash;more ignorant of the
West than the West was of the East, and that, when
he was young, was saying a great deal; and now he
finds himself in a land that has telephones and
motor cars and takes an active interest in flying
machines.
</p>

<p>
China has fundamentally altered.  She used to be
absolutely the most conservative land in the world.
Now she is a land which is seeing so many radical
changes, that a missionary said, when I asked him
a question about China, "You must not rely on me,
for I left China three months ago, so that what I say
may be out of date."
</p>

<p>
China is now progressive; yes, young China
believes intensely in progress, with an optimistic spirit
which reminds the onlooker more of the French
pre-Revolution spirit than of anything else.  And this
intense belief in progress shows itself at every turn;
the Yamen runner has become a policeman, towns are
having the benefit of water-works, schools are being
opened everywhere, railways cover the land.  One
may well ask what has accomplished this change, what
has awakened China?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, like many other great events in history,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
this change of opinion in China should be attributed
to more than one cause.  There are two chief causes.
One may be small, but it is not insignificant; the other
is certainly great and obvious.  The less appreciated
factor that is causing the regeneration of China is
Christianity; the larger and more obvious factor is
the new national movement.
</p>

<p>
The cause of the new national movement was the
sense of humiliation brought about by political events
culminating in the battle of Mukden, where a flagrant
act of insolent contempt for the laws of neutrality was
felt all the more deeply because China had to submit
to that which she was powerless to resist.
</p>

<p>
The events of the last few years are so well known
that I must ask the indulgence of the reader in
recapitulating them.  China, confident in the number
of her people, which reached to a quarter of the
world's population, attempted to assert her rights
of suzerainty over Korea against Japan.  She had
not realised then that Japan was no longer an Eastern
power, where knights with two-handed swords did
deeds of valour and won for themselves everlasting
renown.  And when at Ping-yang the armies met,
the Chinese General ascended a hill that he might
direct the armies of the Celestial Empire with a fan.
He conceived the battle to be merely a small affair,
where a fan could be seen by all the officers engaged.
The result was, of course, that the German-trained
Japanese army had a very easy victory.  The war
ended in the taking of Port Arthur by the Japanese,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
and China was in the humiliating position of having
to appeal to Western countries to secure her territory.
</p>

<p>
So far, however, the sting of her humiliation gave
to China a sense of resentment against all foreigners,
rather than a sense of repentance for her own
shortcomings, and the missionaries found hostility to their
work in every part of China.  That hostility resulted
in the murder of two German Roman Catholic
missionaries in Shantung.  The well-known action
of Germany in demanding a cession of territory as
a punishment for this murder may have been a good
stroke of policy, but it has brought but little honour
either to Germany or to Christianity.  In fact it may
be regarded as a most regrettable action from a
missionary point of view, for it convinced the Chinese
that the missionary was but a part of the civil
administration of a hostile country, and that if China
was to be preserved from the foreigner, missionaries
must be induced to leave the country.  A deep feeling
of national resentment spread over the land, which
was encouraged by some in authority.  The direct
connection between Government patronage of the
anti-foreign movement and the German occupation
of Kiauchau can be deduced from the fact that the
Governor who was responsible for the awful murders
in Shansi had been Governor of Shantung when
Germany took Kiauchau.
</p>

<p>
The result of this bitter feeling was the creation
of a secret and patriotic society which concealed the
nature of its propaganda under a name with a double
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
meaning.  The Boxer Society was, as its name suggests,
apparently an athletic society&mdash;a society which had
for its object the encouragement of the art of
self-defence.  But the name had another signification.
Its real object, as a Chinaman explained to me, was
to "knock the heads of the foreigners off."  It was
a religious as well as a political movement, however.
It had its prophets, who did wonders or were thought
to do them, and its disciples were believed to be
invulnerable to any Western weapon.  It protested
against the movement towards Western ideas, which
it regarded as immoral; it condemned and destroyed
everything Western, from straw hats and cigarettes
to mission houses and railways; its disciples believed
that the spirits that defend China were angry at
the introduction of Western things, that they were
withholding the rain so necessary to the light loess
land of that district, and that the only way they
could be propitiated was by the sacrifice of a Western
life or by the destruction of a Western building.
One of the things that precipitated the siege of
Peking was the apparent success of such an action.
In pursuance of their faith, the Boxers set a light to
the rail-head station of the half-made Hankow-Peking
railway, a place called Pao-ting-fu; the station was
a mere wooden barrack, and blazed up merrily with
an imposing column of smoke; hardly had the smoke
reached the heavens, when the sky was overcast with
heavy thunder-clouds, and in a short time the thirsty
land received the long-wished-for rain, and the Boxer
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
prophets pointed with sinister effect to the heavenly
confirmation of their doctrine.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to remind the reader of the
religious aspect of Boxerdom, so that he shall realise
what its fall meant to many Chinese.  Really their
faith in it was wonderful.  A Boxer, for instance, at
the siege of Peking walked composedly in front of
the Legation, waving his sword and performing
mystic signs; the soldiers first of one then of another
Legation fired on him with no effect; probably his
coolness put out their aim.  Another example of their
credulity was told me at Newchwang.  The Russians
had occupied Newchwang, and, <i>more suo</i>, were pacifying
it; they were shooting all the Boxers on whom they
could lay hands, and, I am afraid, a great number
who were not Boxers.  They chained one of these
fanatics to a stone seat with the intention of executing
him; but they thought they might get some useful
information out of him, so they asked an Englishman
who spoke Chinese perfectly to make inquiries
of him, giving him authority to offer a respite as a
reward.  He went to the prisoner, and sitting down
by him, tried to induce him to save his life by giving
information, but he was met by a contemptuous
refusal; and when he pointed out that the firing
party was there, the misguided man merely said,
"I am a Boxer, and their bullets cannot hurt me."  Another
minute, of course, proved his error.  But his
firmness showed the reality of his conviction.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes this fanaticism had curious results.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
A Boxer prophet assured the village that no
works of the West could hurt him, no bullet could
harm him, no train could crush him.  As a railway
ran near the village, he and all the inhabitants
adjourned thither to put his invulnerability to the test.
The daily train came puffing along, as the Boxer,
waving his sword, stood right in its path.  The driver
was a European, and seeing some one on the line,
pulled up his train to avoid running over him.  The
Boxer pointed to the train triumphantly, and the
astonished villagers became Boxers.  There was,
however, a sceptic who refused to believe, so next
day they repaired again to the line, and the Boxer
again made his passes and uttered his charms.  Alas
for him!  this time the driver was a Chinaman, and
he was not going to stop his master's train because
a coolie fellow got in the way, so he put on full steam
and cut him to pieces, and the village deserted the
Boxer faith to a man.
</p>

<p>
With the relief of Peking, the Boxer Society
fell; but the popular view was not that Boxer
teaching was false, but that the spirits behind
Western religion were stronger than those behind
Boxerdom.  So one of the immediate results of the
fall of the Boxers was to establish the spiritual
prestige of Christianity; the second result was to
inspire the Chinese with a respect for the military
power of the foreigner.  The Boxers had failed,
the foreign powers had taken Peking, the Son of
Heaven had become a fugitive; all this was gall and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
wormwood to the Chinaman.  The sack of Peking
was especially felt, both because of the wanton
destruction that was committed&mdash;one informant told
me he saw a vase worth £200 smashed into a
thousand atoms by a drunken soldier&mdash;and because
the enlightened Chinese knew very well that no
civilised city is sacked at the present time, and
that they were being treated as no other race is
now treated.
</p>

<p>
Yet the old spirit of pride prevented them learning
completely the full truth.  The thinking Chinaman
was still disposed to attribute the victory of the West
to the superior fighting powers of Western men.  A
Chinese gentleman, explaining the fear his people
have of Europeans, said, "They regard you as
tigers."  The troops who sacked Peking were to
the thinking Chinaman but another example of
the well-known truth, that those nearer the savage
state fight better than civilised men, and really,
considering the behaviour of some of the European
troops, no surprise can be felt at this conclusion;
it needed another lesson to make them finally and
thoroughly realise the superiority of our civilisation.
</p>

<p>
The bitterness of their next humiliation made
them ready to learn as they had never been before
in the whole of their history, and events provided
them with teachers who taught them that the
cause of this humiliation was their refusal to accept
Western ideas, and that if they would maintain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
their independence they must learn the art of war
from their conquerors.
</p>

<p>
After the siege of Peking came the Russo-Japanese
war.  The Russians had long been known
and feared by the Chinese; they were to the Chinese
mind the embodiment of the warlike and blood-thirsty
spirit of the West; they were hated for their
cruelty and feared for their prowess.  The awful
story of the massacre of Blagovestchensk in 1900
was still present to the popular mind.  The story
was this.  The Amur divides China from Siberia.
When the Boxer movement broke out the Russians
required all the Chinese to go to their side of the
river; but with sinister intent, they removed all the
boats, so that no one could cross.  The Chinese
pointed this out, and the respectable merchants of
the town presented a petition saying they were ready
to obey the Russian Government in everything, but
without the boats they could not do so; but the
Russians insisted that boats or no boats, they must cross
the Amur; they protested, but in vain; a half-circle
was formed round them by the soldiery, and the
whole Chinese population of the city was driven into
the river at the point of the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
The Japanese were also well known to the
Chinese; they had been till lately, when the
Western movement had altered everything in Japan,
their pupils in civilisation.  The Japanese believed
in Confucius, used Chinese characters, worshipped
in Buddhist temples, sacrificed to ancestors, in fact
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
were in Chinese estimation a civilised race, though
inferior of course to themselves.
</p>

<p>
When these two antagonists met in Manchuria,
the war could not fail to make a deep impression
on China.  To begin with, it was an insult
surpassing that of the sack of Peking to the Chinese
<i>amour propre</i>, to have the war carried on in
Manchuria.  Russia and Japan were disputing over
Korea, and both nations were at peace with China.
Russia might have invaded Japan; Japan might
have invaded Russia, or both might have met in
Korea, but what they did was to select a province
of a neutral State and decide that there should
be the scene of conflict.  What made this more
striking was that they agreed to respect the
neutrality of the rest of China; in fact they selected
their battle-ground with the same equanimity as if
China and her national rights did not exist.
</p>

<p>
But the deepest impression made on the Chinese
was by the victory of the Eastern over the Western.
The Japanese demonstrated that there was no essential
inferiority of the East to the West, and that when an
Eastern race adopted Western military methods it
proved itself superior to the most powerful of the
Western races.  This was the lesson the battle of
Mukden taught the Chinese, and which convinced
the anti-foreign party in China, that however much
they might hate the foreigner, they must adopt
Western methods if they would retain their
independence.  The result was that the progressive and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
anti-foreign parties found themselves at one.  Both
agreed that Western ideas were necessary.  The
first, because they believed in Western progress; the
second, because they felt that the only way to
preserve China from the hated foreigner was to learn
the secret of his military power.  The first thing to
be done was to study Western education, and then
they could hope to hold their own against the
Western races, as Japan had more than held her
own against the Russians.
</p>

<p>
I believe the battle of Mukden will prove one
of the turning points in the history of the world.
Few of us have any conception of the bitterness of
the humiliation of China.  People speak of Russia
as having been humiliated, but my experience is
that the Russians looked at the whole question as
a colonial war in which a bungling Government
embroiled their country&mdash;a war which, if it
demonstrated the incapacity of their officers, proved the
courage of their soldiers.  But the humiliation of
China was intense.  When one remembers the
position that the Emperor occupies in China; when
one also remembers the reverential feeling that
exists towards ancestors, one realises what it must
have meant to the Chinaman that the site of the
tombs of their Emperors should have been the
scene of that titanic struggle between the East
and the West.  But the result of that humiliation
was to burn in the lesson that Japan had taken
the right course, and that, however hateful were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
Western ways, they were a necessity, and that
every lover of China must do his best to introduce
them into the Empire.
</p>

<p>
Of course there are many Chinamen&mdash;nay, I
should think a vast majority&mdash;who intend to
preserve to China the essential points of the Confucian
civilisation; they mean to accept Western ideas only
in so far as they are necessary to struggle against
the West.  Some, no doubt, definitely admire the
West, but most are anxious for a compromise;
they want to preserve China with its customs,
with its essential thought, but to strengthen it by
foreign knowledge and a foreign military system.
The exact degree of what should be preserved in
China and what should be destroyed and replaced
by Western innovations, differs according to the
age and the temperament of the thinkers, but
the principle is most generally accepted&mdash;Western
thought must be grafted on to Eastern civilisation.
When we remember the size of China, we
may well ask ourselves what effect this policy will
have on the rest of the world.  We have at present
a period of reflection, for how long we cannot tell.
The task of welding East and West into one whole
is in practice proving difficult, and at present failure
is very often the result; but with Japan as a
successful example, and with the threat of national
extinction and foreign domination before them, the
Chinese can never give up the effort; and whatever
the exact result may be, I think one may assert
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
without rashness that not only will it fundamentally
alter the whole of China, but through China affect
the whole world.
</p>

<p>
While detailing the causes which have created
the national movement which is now inducing China
to make every effort to perfect her defences against
foreign aggressions, we must not forget that the
awakening of China has a higher side, and one
which we can attribute directly and indirectly to
Christianity.  The influence of Christianity can be
traced back to the seventh century when missions
of Nestorian Christians came to Thibet and China;
they left behind them, it is true, no converts, but
their influence was probably felt through the power
that Lamaism had had over a great part of the
Eastern world.  A learned Japanese, discussing this
subject, said that no one could study Lamaism and
Buddhism without realising how intimately it had
been in touch with some form of Christianity.  Later
on the great Roman Catholic missions, initiated by
St. Francis Xavier in the thirteenth century, began
to work in China, and have slowly but surely raised
up a large population who have been Christians for
many generations.  Their missions were interrupted
by persecutions, but with varying and lately
increasing success they have maintained themselves ever
since.  In 1807 the pioneer of Protestant missions,
Dr. Morrison, began his work and the translation
of the Bible into Chinese.  The work increased, his
mission was followed by other missions, which pursued
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
a policy even more influential in altering the opinion
of China; not only did they with great heroism
preach the Gospel in every province of China, but
they took two actions which have affected China in
a very special degree.
</p>

<p>
First the American missions made the very greatest
effort to get hold of intelligent Chinese men, both
Christian and non-Christian, to teach them Western
knowledge, so that they might understand how
intimately Christianity was connected with Christian
thought.  The result of their efforts has been that
there are a considerable number of enlightened
Chinese gentry who are either Christians or who
have a great sympathy with the Christian side of
Western civilisation.  Sometimes they educated these
men in China, sometimes they induced them to go
to America for their education; and there they were
brought into contact with the intense, yet rather
narrow, New England Christianity.  I had the
honour of meeting many of these men in China,
and I was convinced that they have no small part
in her awakening.
</p>

<p>
The English and American missionaries, under the
leadership of Dr. Williamson, inaugurated a second
policy, which has had far-reaching results in causing
the changes in China.  The Christian Literature
Society was started to supply the Chinese with
translations of the best Western literature.  They
were followed by Chinese imitators who were also
Christians, and who founded a Chinese Commercial
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
Press.  These two bodies have given to China a
vast amount of Western literature, the first on
philanthropic lines with the definite intention of
spreading Christianity, the second on a commercial
basis but with the intention of presenting to their
fellow-countrymen the purer and more beautiful side
of Western thought.  The publications of these two
bodies reach, I am told, to every educated man in
China.  If the humiliations of public events made
the Chinese willing to study Western civilisation, it
was these men who afforded them the means of
studying and understanding the best side of that
civilisation.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps those who have done most to give
the Chinese a proper conception of Christianity are
the Bible Societies, especially the British and Foreign
Bible Society.  Ever since, with the optimism of faith,
the translation of the Scriptures by Dr. Morrison
was published in 1814, they have been scattering the
Christian Scriptures throughout the whole of China,
from Mongolia to Tonkin, and I am told that those
Scriptures are read by men in the highest positions
and with the most conservative antecedents in the
whole empire.  It cannot be doubted that the
indirect fruit of their work has been very great indeed.
China has, through the agencies of these bodies, been
brought into close contact with Christian thought,
and has at last realised the true nature of our
religion.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, there has been the influence of those who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
died for the Christian faith during the many
persecutions to which Christianity has been exposed, and
which culminated in the Boxer persecution.  If
Germany, by her action in Shantung, put before China
a false and most repellent view of Christianity, the
heroic sufferings of the martyred missionaries, both
yellow and white, presented Christianity to a
wondering world in its purest aspect.  After those
thousands of Christians had suffered in Shan-si, the
Home bodies, especially the China Inland Mission,
refused to take any compensation for the blood that
had been shed in the cause of the Gospel.  The
Chinese were then convinced that the German
presentation of Christianity was not the only one; if
Germany could look on Christianity only as a stalking
horse behind which she could creep up to her prey,
the English-speaking races had a holier ideal to teach
and one which was more consonant with the words
of the Founder of our religion.  The sufferings of the
Christians were intense, their heroism was great,
but the result has been commensurate with their
efforts, and an awakening China looks to our
countries, not solely to teach her the art of war
and of killing men, but also to teach her the great
thoughts and the great religion which has before
her very eyes proved capable of producing such
noble men and women.
</p>

<p>
The awakening of China has two aspects.  From
one aspect China is awakening to the value of the
science and the arts of the West; from the other
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
China is awakening to the fact that there is in the
West a power which comes from goodness, and that
goodness has its root in Christian faith.  It is this
twofold aspect of the awakening of China which
is so important to bear in mind, for if she is to
share in our civilisation in the future, it is both
our duty and our interest to see that this great
world-movement is encouraged to develop on its
higher side.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<h4>
WHAT CHINA MEANS TO THE WORLD
</h4>

<p>
The day is past when any one in Europe, whether
Christian or non-Christian, can be indifferent to
what is happening in China.  The Christian has
indeed been for a long time alive to the importance of
these developments, but the ordinary citizen with no
strong religious views has usually neither displayed
nor felt any interest in a country separated from
us by so many miles and by such an untraversable
gulf in thought and language.  If the Christian
has urged the importance of Chinese missions, his
neighbours have answered by asking him why he
cannot leave the Chinese to themselves and to
their own religion.  Whatever justice the opponent
of missions in times past may have thought he had
for this view, he cannot now maintain that the
Chinese question is one which may be put on one
side by any thoughtful man.  The movements of
this vast mass of humanity, amounting to a quarter
of the population of the world, cannot but fail to
have a very real and vital effect on the whole
civilised world.
</p>

<p>
The revolution that is affecting China brings
Europe and America into close contact with a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
country equal to Europe in size, and not far inferior
in productive power.  A few years ago China was
so far away that except as an outlet for trade it
had little interest for people here.  The voyage
occupied many months and was esteemed a hazardous
journey, owing to the dangerous coasts and typhoons
of the China seas.  Now a train-de-luxe conveys the
traveller in a fortnight across Asia to Peking, and
if the accommodation on the Chinese part of the
railway is not altogether luxurious, the traveller
remembers that it is far superior to that on the first
railways opened in our own land.  The journey is
of course tedious, but the fact that business men in
the north of China are talking of always spending
their summer holidays in England, will show how
close China is now to Europe.  It is no exaggeration
to say that in reckoning distance by the time
it takes to complete the journey, China is nearer
to England than London was to Scotland in the
days of Dr. Johnson, while in point of comfort and
convenience there is no comparison.  The journey
from London to Peking is far easier at the present
day than the journey from London to Edinburgh
in the days of Johnson's famous trip to the
Hebrides.
</p>

<p>
If in this way we are getting closer to China,
we are still more growing closer in thought.  No
longer can we speak of a gulf that separates us
from China.  Every year English is becoming more
and more the language of educated men in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
East; even though we cannot read their books,
they are reading ours either in translations or in
the original.  Japan has set the example of having
English taught universally in her high schools,
and now China is following her example.  A
foreigner, talking about Esperanto, remarked: "What
would be the use of making an universal language?
English, at any rate in the East, is the universal
language."  That barbarous patois, "pidgin" or
business English, lives still in China.  It consists of
English roots, enlarged by the addition of Portuguese
words, put into Chinese idiom and pronounced Chinese
fashion.  But "pidgin" English is fast giving way
to pure English, spoken most commonly with a
marked American accent.
</p>

<p>
If this growing proximity of China compels the
attention of the civilised world, the virgin wealth of
her mineral resources and the cheapness of her labour
have excited the cupidity of the Western capitalist,
and it is daily more obvious that China must become
the centre of international politics, therefore the extent
to which she will affect the rest of the world should be
a matter for careful consideration.  India, it will be
urged, has long been in contact with Europe, and the
effect on Europe is small.  Why should there be any
difference when another Oriental race comes in close
proximity with Europe?  Putting on one side the
fact that India has, both in trade and in politics, had
a very great effect on England, it can be answered
that there is an essential difference between the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
brown inhabitants of India and the yellow race.
The former are, through religion or custom, unable
to accommodate themselves to the conditions of
Western civilisation; the latter have shown
themselves such adepts at accepting Western life that
they have excelled the white man, to his great
annoyance, in his own civilisation.  The Chinaman, who
is forbidden to enter America, Australia, and South
Africa, is refused admittance, not because he has been
untried or because he has been tried and found
wanting, but because he has been tried in the three
continents and found by all who have tried him
eminently efficient&mdash;so efficient that if he were
allowed to continue in those countries, he would soon
render the presence of the white settler unnecessary.
He has been tried in three just balances and been
found of such value that the white voter is unanimous
in demanding his exclusion.  But even the most
aggressive Chinese exclusionist can scarcely hope to
exclude him from his own country, and the Chinaman
who stays at home is probably a better man than
the Chinaman who goes abroad.
</p>

<p>
Western civilisation may be expected to grow with
equal rapidity in China as it has in Japan.  Obviously
Japan is the precedent that China will follow rather
than India, whether Hindu or Mohammedan.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago a man would have been classed
as an eccentric who dared foretell that Russia would
be defeated by Japan.  When Japan talked about
going to war with Russia, Russia laughed.  Who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
can tell how we shall speak of China a few years
hence?  For Japan after all is only the same size
in population as Great Britain, but China is eight
times as large.
</p>

<p>
There are three ways in which China may affect
Europe.  Militarily, she may menace her by her
enormous armies enlisted from her vast population.
Commercially, she may afford an outlet for our trade
far greater than we possess at the present time, and
perhaps be a competitor in trade and a place where
the capital of Europe will be invested.  Morally,
she may either depress or elevate our social morals.
Perhaps the reader may be inclined to smile at the
idea of China being in a higher moral condition than
Europe, so as to be able to react on her beneficially,
but stranger things have happened; and if Europe
follows the example of France in deterioration, and
China continues to advance with the same rapidity,
China might easily excel Europe in morals.
</p>

<p>
Let us first deal with the question from the
military point of view.  The military authorities who
know the Chinese seem to be equally divided in
opinion; many are confident that they are an
unwarlike race, others maintain and bring evidence to
prove that under competent officers they have great
military qualities.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, for instance, the development of
the military power of China was regarded as a possible
danger to the world, and especially to England or
Russia.  It was pointed out that China might easily
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
descend with a huge army on to India in the distant
future, or she might turn her arms northward and
conquer the wide districts of Siberia.  Now the
popular view is the reverse, and the military power
of China is regarded as a thing incapable of great
development.  A Japanese diplomatist with whom
we discussed the question ridiculed the idea of the
yellow peril and smiled at the suggestion that China
could ever be a nation great in war.  Certainly her
present military power can be safely ignored except
in Manchuria; whether that power is capable of
development is a moot point.  Believers in the
war-like possibilities of China point out that as a matter
of fact China is by right of conquest suzerain to such
warlike races as the Tibetans and the Ghurkas, and
that her empire reaches as far as Turkestan.  In
answer it is urged that the victors were not the
Chinese, but the conquerors and present rulers of
the Chinese, the northern Manchus; who, till they
were absorbed by Chinese civilisation, spoke a different
language and wrote a different character.
</p>

<p>
The Manchus are far from being extinct, though
through years of sensual indulgence they have lost
their virility; but the discipline of religion or the
call of a national emergency might restore the
war-like qualities of the race.  It was only in 1792 that
the Chinese, under Sund Fo, defeated the Ghurkas,
and we must allow that a race who could defeat these
gallant soldiers must be skilled and brave in war.
On the other hand I was assured that the Manchus,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
so far from showing any courage in the war with
Japan, were the first to flee, and that they differ
in nothing from the Chinese except that they are
pensioners and ride horses.  Those who disbelieve in
the courage of the Chinese say the Chinese never
had any courage except of a passive order; that they
would endure suffering against any race on earth,
and that their whole history tells that tale; that
they have been subject in turn to the Mongols, the
Kins, and the Manchus; and that the period of the
Ming dynasty when they were free, was only because
the Mongols had reduced every nation within many
thousands of miles to subjection, and then they
themselves had fallen a prey, not to the Chinese arms
directly, but to the enervating and destructive effects
of Chinese civilisation which rendered them absolutely
unable to fight.
</p>

<p>
Those who argue in this way point to that great
feature of Chinese scenery, the fortified wall.  That
Great Wall of China, climbing hill and dale, was
built to keep the northern and warlike tribes from
harrying the peace-loving and industrious Chinaman.
Behind that wall lie nothing but fortress after
fortress; every city is walled, and those walls tell their
own tale.  A warlike race never dwells in walled
cities.  When the traveller enters Japan after
visiting China, the first thing which strikes him is the
absence of walled cities.  The villages and towns lie
along the roads as they do in our own country instead
of clustering behind the tall and gloomy walls of China.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
Again, those who say the Chinese will never fight,
point out that they have never been able to reduce
two savage races right in their midst, the Maios and
Lolos.  One devoted missionary who had spent many
years of his life in the thankless task of attempting
to approach these savage Lolos, gave us an interesting
account of the relation between the Lolos and
the Chinese which certainly does not show that the
Chinese have much military skill.  The Lolos are a
sort of Highland caterans who live in the mountains
in the west of China, and from time to time raid
the peace-loving Chinese villages.  The Chinese then
retaliate by organising a large force, who advance
on the Lolo country and burn their villages.  The
Lolos rarely offer any direct resistance, as they realise
they are hopelessly outnumbered, but take an
opportunity to raid another village and to slaughter
hundreds of defenceless Chinese.  If the forces are
anything like equal, the Lolos will fight, and even
sometimes when the forces are wholly unequal.  On
one occasion seven Lolos and two women put to flight
three hundred Chinese soldiers, killing forty and
wounding many more.  The Chinese consequently
live in considerable fear of those Highland barbarians,
whose fierce yells and savage onslaught produce
absolute panic in their troops.
</p>

<p>
Officers who have commanded Chinese troops seem
generally to believe in their capabilities.  Gordon, for
instance, spoke in the highest terms of the soldiers
who formed his "ever victorious army," and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
English officers who commanded the Weihaiwei
regiment and those who commanded the Chinese
volunteers at the siege of Peking spoke equally well
of their men.  It is reported that the Chinese soldiers
at the siege of Tientsin would carry the wounded
back out of the range of fire when no European
soldiers could be found ready to perform this dangerous
task, but of this story I could find no first-hand
confirmation.  But whether the Chinese in times to
come will develop an efficient army or whether they
do not, the most competent judges affirm that Chinese
military greatness will always make for peace; that
they will never wage a war of aggression; and that,
so far from being a menace to the world, they will
prove to be a security for the world's peace in the Far
East.  In fact it is the continuance of China's
military weakness rather than the growth of her military
power which is most likely to disturb the political
atmosphere.  China is far too rich a prize to be safe
if unguarded, and the acquisition of her wealth will
always prove a temptation to her needy neighbours.
</p>

<p>
The integrity of the Chinese empire is for many
reasons a most desirable thing, and that integrity can
best be maintained by an increase of China's military
power.
</p>

<p>
One of the reasons why this is so much to be
desired is from the commercial effect which China
may have on the rest of the world.  If the vast masses
of her singularly excellent workmen are to be
exploited by powers who have no thought for either
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
hers or the world's welfare; if the sweated den of
the alien is a menace to the healthy conditions of the
working man in London; if the policy of such
philanthropists as Lord Shaftesbury has been at all beneficial
to the world at large, the sudden introduction of
hundreds of thousands of ill-paid but efficient working
men to the great Western market will have a deleterious
effect on the social conditions of the civilised
world.  It is obviously far more simple to bring the
factories to China than to bring the Chinaman to the
factories, and this will be freely done if ever the flag
of the foreigner waves over China.  The great advantages
that China can offer of cheap labour, cheap
coal and cheap carriage, coupled with the security
of a European flag, will have the effect of attracting
to China a very large number of the world's industries.
If this is done gradually, so that the internal
market in China increases proportionally, this will
not result in any evil to other nations.  China will
share in the wealth of the world, and will be at
once a large producer and a large consumer; but if
before Western civilisation has been assimilated by
the working classes Western factories are extensively
started in China the result will be one of those
dislocations of social conditions which we include under
the name of sweating.
</p>

<p>
Western conditions of labour in Western countries
may be deemed by some to be hard, but no one can
doubt that if Western conditions of labour were forced
on a population which did not understand them, they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
would have a tendency to become definitely oppressive.
The Chinese coolie will, I fear, be as little able
to maintain his ground against the foreign contractor
supported by the arms of a foreign power, as the
Congo native is to maintain his rights against his
Belgian oppressor; and unless Western powers have
the humanity and wisdom to resist those of their own
nations who will clamour to make money out of
Chinese labour, Western dominance in China is not
to be desired by Western wage-earners.

<br />
HANKOW, THE CHICAGO OF CHINA. RIVER AT LOW WATER, 600 MILES FROM THE SEA. HAN-YANG IRONWORKS
</p>

<p>
One of the most impressive sights in China is the
Han-yang Ironworks.  They employ three thousand
men, and are owned by a body of Chinese capitalists.
They have found it worth while to triple their plant
within the last two or three years, and one can hardly
wonder when one realises that, though the labourers
are paid a very high rate according to Chinese scale,
they only get sixpence a day, and even allowing that
it requires three Chinamen to do the work of one
Englishman, which is a higher proportion than is
generally claimed, obviously there is a very large
margin of profit to be made by the owners of the
works.  It is worthy of note that the Chinese have
been unable at present to produce any native
engineers; sixteen Europeans of various nationalities
manage and control the works, though they are
owned by Chinese, but the skilled work is all done
by Chinese.  For instance, we saw a man straightening
the rails with a steam hammer; it was very
skilled work, and I was told he was making 7d. or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
8d. a day.  If any social reformer, if any one interested
in the condition of the working classes, has time to
consider this question and to escape from that
parochial mind which so distorts the importance of
things, he will see that the conditions of the working
classes in Europe will depend to a greater degree on
the proper development of the social conditions of
China than on any factor at home.  To put it briefly,
if the fourth of the labour of this world is living under
sweating conditions, the other three-fourths may
consider themselves lucky if their income is not cut down
by 25 per cent.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if the development of China is
allowed to pursue its normal course, and education
and enlightenment are encouraged to proceed by equal
steps with material well-being, the commercial
conditions of China, so far from being injurious, will prove
beneficial to the world at large.  The internal market,
for one thing, will tend to keep pace with China's
productions.  If China exports, she will also import;
the volume of trade will no doubt be enormously
increased, and that trade will bring prosperity to
China and to those other countries who are trading
with her.  Her people will gradually grow
accustomed to Western conditions, and, if China maintains
her independence, those conditions will not be allowed
to become too onerous to the poorer classes.  The
wealth of another country does not injure her
neighbours; it is rather her poverty which injures them.
There is always the danger that the poorer country
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
will drain the capital from the richer country, and
that a rich country becomes harsh to a poor country
in the same way that the creditor is harsh to the
debtor; certainly it would be most undesirable if
a sudden industrial expansion in China paralysed
many industrial undertakings in England by depriving
them of the capital they needed for enlargement, and
it would be equally undesirable to have any industrial
undertaking in China controlled by a Board of Directors
in London, whose one object was to increase their
dividends, and who were ignorant of and therefore
indifferent to the injury that might be incidentally
done to the welfare of thousands of Chinese who fell
under their power.
</p>

<p>
And this brings me to the third point of how
China may affect the rest of the world.  She may,
and most probably will, degrade the moral tone of
Europe.  On the other hand, it will be quite possible
that she may act as a moral tonic.  We scarcely realise
the nature of the chains that bind one part of our
civilisation to another.  To hear men talk, one would
suppose that the great factors in the government of
mankind are the laws and regulations made by kings
and popular assemblies; but a deeper inquiry must
show that it is only the smaller part of a man's life
that is controlled by law, the greater part is controlled
by custom or fashion which is enforced, to use the
technical term, by the sanction of public opinion.
Consider, for instance, the customs of dress, or of
manners, or the hours we keep, or the way we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
refer to things, or even our very thoughts&mdash;they
are all subject to this power; the State does not
generally command any particular dress, yet there
is a large and increasing measure of uniformity in
dress.  You may go from Asia to America, from
Vancouver to Vladivostock, and you will see
uniformity in the rules of dress.  This uniformity is all
the more remarkable, because its laws, instead of being
fixed and stationary, are constantly altered; indeed,
in comparison with the power of fashion, the powers
of the greatest autocrat or of the most efficient public
office are as nothing.  The autocrat may give an order;
the public office, with its endless clerks and forms,
with its miles of red-tape, may try to see that order
carried out; but may quite possibly fail.  But fashion,
issuing her capricious orders, has no office, no clerks,
no printed forms that have to be filled up to secure
obedience, yet her subjects yield such willing service
that they seek for information from every quarter as
to the nature of her commands, and when they know
them, they count neither money nor comfort to be of
importance compared with obedience to their mistress.
The world, while it wonders at its own submission,
enlarges or reduces its clothes, alters its head-gear,
and further, will even change its manners, its speech,
and its thoughts.  The latest fashion-book is but the
exaggeration of a world-power; the same power that
compels women to tighten their skirts and widen their
hats, makes their husbands talk about socialism and
observe Empire Day.  The power of fashion lies in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
this, that while every one obeys, no one is conscious
of any difficulty in obeying; the chains with which
fashion binds this world may be so strong that the
strongest nature cannot break them, yet they are so
light that the most sensitive natures are not conscious
of their restraint.
</p>

<p>
But this great power of fashion has its limits, and
those are the limits of our civilisation.  The mandate
of the dressmaker may reach from Siberia to Peru, but
it has no power in Mohammedan, Hindu, or Confucian
lands; the Turkish lady still veils her face, the
Hindu still adheres to his caste, the Confucian up to
this moment still preserves his queue and his blue
robe, but if China accepts our civilisation this must
change.  The modern Chinaman dresses in Western
fashion; the loose flowing garment of China acts as
a sort of barometer by which the extent of European
pressure can be tested; up-country they are as loose
as ever, but in Shanghai, wherever Chinese dress is
still preserved, it has grown tight.  A change typical
of what may happen if the union between the
civilisations takes place without any guidance may now be
seen in the streets of Shanghai; the dress of the
women is shaped in the Chinese fashion, they wear
the traditional coat and trousers, but the cut of those
garments offends both East and West alike by their
great exiguity.
</p>

<p>
Every one would allow that Western fashions, or,
at any rate, men's fashions, must to a great extent
affect China, but there is a deeper thought beyond;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
Western fashions will not merely affect Chinese dress,
but they will also affect Chinese thought, and when
they have incorporated Chinese thought into Western
civilisation, when the conquest is complete and China
and the West are one, a reaction will take place, and
that which has subdued China to the yoke of Western
fashion will give in its turn power to China to control
the Western world.  Without suggesting for a moment
that Peking fashions will take the place of Paris
fashions, or that the Englishman will grow a queue,
I do suggest that there are many precedents in history
for expecting that such a moral force as the Chinese
reverence for parents, or such an immoral position as
the Chinese contempt for the working-man, will not
be without its effect on the Western world.  Again
and again it has been pointed out by both missionary
and Government official, that so great is the power of
China, that she brings into subjugation to her thought
any one who is long resident in her country.  If it
should happen that the Western world should neglect
the Chinaman when it has the opportunity of teaching
and directing him, longing as he is to learn about
Western civilisation, the punishment of the West will
be that she will, in years to come, be influenced for
evil by the power of the great Celestial Empire.  If, on
the other hand, the East should turn towards Christianity,
and, taught by Christianity, should learn to
live a higher life, the example of her faith and of her
morality will in years to come react beneficially on the
Western world.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<h4>
ORIENTAL AND OCCIDENTAL
</h4>

<p>
The West cannot either by right or through
self-interest ignore the problem that China has to solve.
From being the most conservative country in the
world, she has become a country in which there is
rapid change.  The whole civilisation of this vast
country of 400,000,000 is becoming fundamentally
altered by the importation into it of ideas and
thoughts which are not native to her, and which
have been created by a system of religion and by a
history belonging to nations very different to herself.
The full difficulty does not present itself till after
some thought.  The problem is quite different from
that which has been before mankind in other parts
of the world.  China is trying to accept Western
civilisation, but there is a danger that it will be
without Christianity.  I know that many Europeans
living in Tientsin and Shanghai, who give but little
thought to the problems before them, somewhat
vaguely hope that in the near future China will
become a European nation; but a little consideration
must convince everybody that this is impossible.
We have also already shown that China is quite
determined&mdash;in fact, she has no alternative&mdash;not to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
remain the old conservative country that lives on
ancient traditions, that looks back two thousand
years for all teaching in the arts of government.
</p>

<p>
If China, therefore, is neither to become Western
nor to remain what she is, of necessity she will have
to blend the two civilisations together and to take a
part from each.  The Chinese themselves, with a
sanguineness for which they have no warrant, are
quite certain that this is an easy matter.  They tell
the inquirer that they have considered it well, and
that they see their way completely through it.  They
intend to select from Europe only those things that
are advantageous to the race, and they expect to have
no difficulty in weaving these incongruous elements
into their own very complete system of thought.
Statesmen seriously say that three or four months'
extra study will enable the educated Chinaman to
learn all that is necessary of Western civilisation,
and then those who have acquired this knowledge
can return to China and teach their fellow-countrymen;
and it is impossible to convince the Chinese
that the uniting together of two different webs of
thought is a matter of extreme difficulty, and, it may
be added, of extreme risk.  The pleasing dream that
you can arbitrarily select the good points of West and
East and weave them into one is the very reverse of the
truth.  What naturally happens is the very opposite.
There is a tendency to preserve that which is bad and
not that which is good in two different systems of
thought when they are united into one.  The reason
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
probably is that as the bad has its common origin in
the wickedness of human nature, it belongs to both
systems of thought, and therefore both the Chinaman
and the Western meet on common ground when they
meet in vice or vileness.  On the other hand, the
virtues of both are the result of moral cultivation
resting on authorities which are not recognised by
either.  Therefore the tendency is to waive all moral
obligations as resting on controverted grounds.
Whatever may be the cause, the result is obvious&mdash;the
Westernised Oriental, unless a Christian, is as a rule
only one shade better than the Orientalised Western.
</p>

<p>
While the careless thinker hopes generally that
good will come out of the union of the two, he is as
a rule terrified lest there should be any tendency to
mingle Western with Eastern thought in any one of
whom he is fond.  A leading man at Tientsin,
extolling the healthy climate of the place, related how
he had kept his children there ever since they were
born.  His friend from home, ignorant of life in a
Chinese port, said in an appreciative way, "How nice
it must be for your children to be able to speak
Chinese; I suppose you encourage them to learn it?"  The
dweller in China turned on him in anger and said,
"Thank God, my children do not know one word of
Chinese; I would send them home to-morrow if I
caught them learning a single sentence."  This
enthusiasm for ignorance of the language of a great nation
is extraordinarily difficult to understand until the
danger of the mixture of Eastern and Western thought
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
is realised.  Experience has taught those who have
lived in China that it is only a few that can come
unscathed through the terrible trial of having to live
in two moral atmospheres.
</p>

<p>
One of the most striking books that has ever been
written is "Indiscreet Letters from Peking."  The
book is marvellous in the power it has of bringing
before the eyes of its reader those awful scenes during
the siege of Peking, but it is far more wonderful in
the character that it imputes to the hypothetical
narrator&mdash;a character typical of a man who is equally
at home in England and in China; and in that
character is portrayed a true but curiously unpleasant
picture of the characteristics of both races.  The
narrator has the courage of a lion; he is
absolutely without any sense of honour.  He fires at an
adversary under the flag of truce.  He misuses a
Manchu woman who in the horrors of the sack
throws herself on his mercy.  He connives at the
breaking of a solemnly pledged word of honour by a
soldier.  The character is not overdrawn; characters
such as these are common in a mixed world, and it
is natural that English people should fear that their
children should grow up so unutterably vile.  But if
the Englishman fears for his child, ought he to ignore
the welfare of the country in which he lives, and can
we pass over this whole problem as something that
does not concern us; for what he fears for his child
will happen to the whole Chinese nation.
</p>

<p>
The blending together of the East and the West
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
may be accomplished with the ease which the
Chinaman expects&mdash;but not in the way in which he or
anybody else could wish&mdash;it may be accomplished by
the eradication of all that is good in either race, on
the common ground of vice and sin and evil and
cruelty; unless, indeed, the efforts of those who are
now labouring to weave together that which is good
in both civilisations are supported.  The difficulty
of preserving the good points and high qualities of
Chinese thought is only equalled by the difficulty of
introducing the splendid traditions of the West and
grafting them on to the Chinese stock.  What success
has followed the efforts of those who are thus labouring
is rather to be credited to the intensity of their
efforts, to their single-hearted purpose, to their ready
self-denial, than to the ease or simplicity of their task.
</p>

<p>
No man of any feeling or any conscience could
pass indifferently by a single individual eating the
berries of a deadly plant, unconscious that they were
poison.  What shall be said, then, if we allow, not
only one individual but a fourth of the population
of the world, to eat of a deadly poison which must
deprive them of all happiness and of life, which must
condemn them by millions to the misery of the very
blackest darkness, where the only motives known are
selfishness, lust, pride, and cruelty, for this is what
certainly will happen to China if she accepts the
materialism of the West.
</p>

<p>
Western thought is very powerful.  The way it
has dominated the forces of nature gives it a great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
prestige.  As the Chinaman learns about steam and
electricity, about the telephone, the flying machine,
radium, and a thousand more Western inventions, he
cannot fail to be impressed, he must admit that these
people have knowledge.  Do not for a moment imagine
that, after such an illumination, he will be able to go
back to the works of Confucius and learn again the old
maxims, many of which are antipathetic to Western
thought&mdash;yes, even more incongruous to Western
than they are to Christian thought.  How will he,
for instance, read Confucius' condemnation of war
when the Japanese and Germans and Russians are
shouting into his ears, "By war ye shall live and
by war alone."
</p>

<p>
In an interview I had with that great statesman,
Tong-Shao-Yi, he said, "We respect Confucius
because he has never taught any man to err."  Unlike
the teaching of Christianity, Confucius
preaches that the test of truth is worldly success, and
therefore by that test his preaching will be tried and
found wanting by the materialist.  The materialist
will say, if Confucius never taught men to err, how is
it that the Western nations who are ignorant of his
teaching have succeeded, and that China, who
outnumbers them greatly, and who after years of
education and training and of following faithfully his
teaching, has failed?  How is it, they will ask, that
she is so powerless, that were it not for European
jealousies she could not stand a day before the least
warlike of these Western nations?  The Confucian
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
will answer, "He taught us to despise war, and that
is why we are weak."  The materialist will certainly
retort, "So he has taught you to err."  Confucianism
must fall before Western materialism.  I do not
speak of Buddhism, for that is falling so quickly that
its influence may be said to be almost gone.  China
will be left stripped of religion, robbed of her old ideas,
and not clothed with new ones, wandering into all
the misery and humiliation that vice and sin can
bring upon mankind, till the curse of her millions in
misery will go out against the harsh unfeeling West,
who could leave her thus blind and helpless without
a guide.
</p>

<p>
The call is great.  Those who have knowledge
have no right to keep it to themselves.  The Christian
and the Confucian agree in this, as they do in much
else, that all knowledge must be shared.  One of the
purposes of this book is to arouse my readers to the
importance of taking some action.  Had they had an
opportunity of going to China and seeing things for
themselves, I would only have asked them to think;
but as there are many who have not had that
opportunity, I would try and show them the transitional
condition through which China is passing, the danger
of that condition ending in disaster, a disaster wide
as the world itself.  I hope to show them what is
being done at the present time to lead the Chinese
empire into safe paths, and to illuminate her with
the highest knowledge of the West.  Many efforts
have been made, and there has been much success.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
am glad to testify publicly to the heroic and
self-denying character of the missions, but those who are
most successful are those who frankly say China can
never be led by aliens.
</p>

<p>
No race loves the alien, and the further away the
alien is in blood and language the less he is loved;
therefore the Chinese above all races are least fitted
to be led by the European, as they differ from him in
most racial characteristics.  If they are to be led by
their own race, their own race must be fit to lead
them.  They must have leaders who understand the
whole of Western knowledge, and will be able to
take what is true and leave what is false.  A
Japanese thinker said the other day, "Our people have
made a great mistake&mdash;they have taken the false and
left the true part of Western thought."  Let us hope
that China may be preserved from such an error, that
she may learn Western knowledge so thoroughly and
so well that she may be able to distinguish the good
from the bad, the beautiful from the vile in our system
of thought.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<h4>
FOREIGN RELATIONS OF CHINA
</h4>

<p>
It is impossible to study any Chinese question and
ignore the relations of China with foreign powers.
They are always curious and generally unique.
Certainly any one who goes to China for the
purpose of studying the mission question cannot
but be struck at the extraordinary treaty rights
possessed by missionaries.  In most countries the
teacher of religion has no peculiar rights.  He is,
alas! more often bullied than favoured by the
modern State, even if that State should profess
itself well inclined towards religion.  Therefore one
would naturally expect in China, where Christianity
is reputed to be disliked, that those who teach it
would have to contend with every form of disability
that a hostile State could inflict.
</p>

<p>
A feeling of marvel comes over the mind when
one realises that in this land of contradictions the
persecuted missionary enjoys quite peculiar
privileges.  The ordinary foreigner cannot, for instance,
travel in China except by the courtesy of the
Government&mdash;a courtesy, indeed, which is never
refused; but a missionary may travel freely.  The
ordinary foreigner has no right to stay in any
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
town in China with the exception of the treaty
ports; a missionary may stay where he likes.  The
ordinary man cannot buy land; the missionary has a
right to purchase land for the purpose of teaching
Christianity.
</p>

<p>
So it came about, when we were in China, that
His Majesty's Consul, with all the might of England
at his back, was unable to buy a suitable site to
erect a house where he could bring his wife.  He
was living in a temple, and temples in China are
not very comfortable.  I should explain to the
uninitiated that every Buddhist temple has
guest-rooms attached to it&mdash;Chinese rooms largely
composed of wooden screens; and these temples are let
out as residences by a people whose faith has less
hold upon their affections than their purse.  Now,
ladies are not as a rule prepared to live in a house
with paper partitions in a climate where the winters
are extremely cold; so the Consul asked a missionary
to buy a piece of land on which he could erect a
suitable house, and he had almost succeeded when
the Chinese Government found out that the land
was not to be used for missionary purposes and
refused to allow the sale.  This does seem a strange
situation when one remembers that had that Consul
resigned his appointment and joined a missionary
body, he could have bought the land and settled
his wife comfortably in four solid stone walls, but
because he was England's representative and not
a missionary he had to shiver between wood and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
paper screens, and this in a country which is
supposed to hate missionaries.
</p>

<p>
The explanation of this curious situation is really
twofold.  First, the hatred that the official bears for
the missionary is not of such an intense character as
to induce him to offer a very strenuous resistance to
the missionaries who desire to buy land; and secondly,
missionaries have peculiar and special rights secured
to them by a series of treaties among the most
curious in the history of diplomacy.
</p>

<p>
In 1844 the Americans got by treaty a right to
the free exercise of the Christian religion in the open
ports.  This right, sufficiently remarkable in itself, has
often been stipulated by a State for its own nationals
resident in a foreign country, but I doubt if it has
ever before been known for a country to insist on
the right of preaching a religion to somebody else's
citizens.  This was obviously an interference of the
sovereign rights of China.
</p>

<p>
It was pushed even further in 1860.  The French
and English had just completed the sack of the
"Summer Palace," and whatever the justice or the
injustice of the war may have been, China had tasted
her first great lesson of humiliation from the hand
of Western powers, and was in no condition to resist
any of their demands.  The English and the French
made treaties, most of them concerned with
commercial and military matters with which it is not
necessary to trouble the reader, and the French had
a condition which was quite reasonable, that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
Chinese should restore all the buildings that had
been destroyed in the late troubles; the wording
of the clause was so vague that it could be made
to apply, and did apply, to any building which had
been destroyed at any previous time in the history
of China, but the most remarkable part of the clause
needs further explanation.  The French had as their
interpreter a very able Jesuit, Père Delamarre, and
as the French Minister could not read Chinese, he
had to trust his interpreter with regard to the
Chinese version, and this man inserted into the
treaty two other provisions, one securing that
Christians should have a right to the free exercise
of their religion all over China, and the other that
French missionaries should have the right to rent
land in all the provinces in the empire and to buy
and construct houses.  When this pious fraud was
discovered, the French Minister thought it would
do no good to denounce his interpreter, and
therefore the treaty was treated by the French as
binding and never questioned by the Chinese; the other
powers profited by it under the "most favoured
nation" clause.
</p>

<p>
The Roman Catholics a few years later pushed
the wording of this treaty to its uttermost.  Their
missions had been at work for 150 years or more,
and they could prove a great number of confiscations
which had to be made good by the Chinese.
Just at that time in France Napoleon III. was trying
to establish a doubtful title by the help of the Pope,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
and it was his policy to push in every way the
interests of the Roman Catholics.  China had felt
the weight of European armies and she was unable
to resist these claims, and so it came about that
the very country which now is the centre of free
thought was the means of forcing Christianity upon
the Chinese through fear of her armed power.
</p>

<p>
Can you be surprised at the answer I got when
I asked a Chinese statesman, who I knew was
sympathetic with the teaching of Christianity, why China,
who had always professed, and to a very great extent
had practised tolerance, should persecute Christianity?
His reply was, the Chinese did not hate Christianity,
and were indeed tolerant of missions, but they still
disliked them, because Christianity is the religion of
the military races, and they had a historical tradition
that the advance of Christianity was connected with war.
</p>

<p>
This bad reputation has been intensified by
the action of the Germans.  No reasonable man
can condemn the Germans for wishing to enlarge
and develop their trade.  We can understand the
patriotic German saying that it was the duty of
Germany to establish good government in Shantung,
but it is very hard to understand how any one can
defend the taking of Kiauchau on the ground that
certain German missionaries had been murdered.
The taking of Kiauchau by the Germans has
completed the work begun by the French.  Christianity
and the foreign relations of China are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
inextricably mixed up, and every Chinaman, believed
till lately that Christianity was the religion which
has led foreign nations to enter his land.  "First
the missionary, then the trader, lastly the
gunboat," has been too often the order of advance.  I
am happy to be able to say that the Americans and
the English have made great efforts to dissociate
themselves from this evil, and have tried to avoid
any appearance of such a connection.  I was told
that in Shansi, owing to the indemnity for the
murders of missionaries being retained to China and
spent on founding a University instead of being
accepted by the missions, Protestant missions are very
popular.  "You have only to say you are an English
clergyman," said my Chinese informant, "and every
door will be open to you."
</p>

<p>
The present aspect of foreign affairs has tended
to destroy the unfortunate connection between
Christianity and foreign aggression.  The two great powers
whose armies have met in Manchuria have neither of
them any interest in missions.  Russia has never had
any missions in China.  She forbade them, I
understand, because they were likely to embroil her in
unnecessary wars.  Japan, of course, has none.  The
Germans, who made the murder of missionaries the
reason of aggression, have not many missionaries in
China belonging to their nationality.  China, therefore,
is coming to look upon Christianity as not quite so
dangerous a thing as it seemed when it was
essentially the religion of the French and of the English
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
whose armies and navies then held China in fear.
Still the political situation cannot but have great
interest to the missionary.  Even while he rejoices
that the foreign relations of China and his work are
not so intimately connected as they used to be, he
must ask himself, what will the result to my work be,
if in the great world struggle Japan or Russia should
dominate?  At present he fears Japan more than
Russia; and his fears are shared, but for other reasons,
by the Chinese.
</p>

<p>
The wildest and most ambitious schemes are
accredited to Japan, I cannot say with how much
truth.  Her purse is empty, but she has far more
courage and skill in war than most nations.  If she
possessed even one part of China she might add to
her wealth to such an extent that no race could dare
to oppose her, while if she governed China, her armies,
supported by the wealth of that mighty empire, might
threaten the stability of Europe.  She is reported to
have two regiments working as private individuals in
Fukien, and to be prepared to seize the province in
case of any disorder.  The fact that there are many
Japanese in the province, and that all the Japanese are
trained soldiers, gives some cloak to this suggestion.
The Fukienese speak a different dialect to the rest of
China, and they have a natural geographical frontier,
which would enable the Japanese to maintain
themselves there if they were once established.
</p>

<p>
Again, the recent events have shown that they are
preparing to exercise sovereign rights over Chinese
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
territory in Manchuria.  On the other hand, Russia is
arming; she is double-tracking the railway from
St. Petersburg to Irkutsk, and she is getting ready again
for a struggle in Manchuria; the gossip among the
officers there is that there is to be a war; the
Russians do not for a moment regard themselves as
defeated; they think of the late campaign merely as
an "unfortunate incident."
</p>

<p>
But the most important development in Russian
policy is the proposed railway across Mongolia which
will give Russia an entrance to the west of China
and into Peking.  It is hard to see how, if an advance
were made along that line, Japan could in any way
resist Russia; the whole breadth of China would lie
between them.  Meanwhile the Germans of the east
have perfected a railway system which converts
Kiauchau from being an out-of-the-way place which no
one cared about, to a door into the very heart of
China.  In commercial circles in China it is reported
that the Commandant of the Tientsin garrison
suggested that the object of the building of the German
Fleet was not so much to conquer England as to
ensure that Germany should be able to maintain her
position in the Far East and make full use of
Kiauchau as a way by which her armies might enter
China.  When one looks at the map and sees how
China is surrounded by these powers, and how they
are pressing upon her, one realises why the Chinese
are feeling that Western education is an absolute
necessity, and that if they are to maintain their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
independence they must understand the arts of war.
A great Viceroy was reported to have said that
he frankly expected China to be conquered, and to
learn from her conquerors the Western arts which
would in turn enable her to dominate the West;
for this has been her history in the past, that may
be her history in the future, and I think that the
nations, who propose to conquer her, will do wisely
if they consider what might be the result of her
influence on them.
</p>

<p>
China is trying to defend herself by building a
navy and creating an army.  The navy is rather
an <i>opéra bouffe</i> concern; every now and then she
talks of having ships; the representatives of all
the shipbuilders of the world fly to Peking and
try in every way to induce China to buy a fleet
which they offer to provide at the very shortest
notice, but at present she has none.  She has, as a
practical step, created a training school of officers.
It consists only of some 140 men, and is taught by
two British officers lent her by our navy.  They said
that there was the greatest difficulty in getting the
Chinese to be practical; they induced the Government
at last to put an old ship at their disposal.  For
a long time this was refused, and when it was granted
it was regarded as a most wonderful and original
departure.  The Chinese way of training naval
officers would have been to have instructed them
on literary subjects, and to encourage them to write
essays and poems on the sea.  To take them out on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
the Yangtsze in a ship and actually to show them
how a ship was managed, was a wholly new idea,
but one of which they approve under the impulse
of the modern fashion of doing things in accordance
with Western traditions.
</p>

<p>
As to the army, its exterior is certainly not
prepossessing; far and away the most efficient part of
it has been created by Yuan-Shi-Kei in Manchuria,
and the Chinese are very anxious to show it to the
passing traveller.  Both times when we passed
through Manchuria, on every station were armed
guards, and in one case they were inspected by a
General who was travelling in our train.  He was
saluted by the officers in charge in Chinese fashion,
which is a modified form of a kow-tow, and consists
to all intents and purposes of a curtsey.  It had a
distinctly funny appearance to see the officers in
charge of the guards curtseying as we steamed into
the stations.  Down at Nanking the army was far
less smart&mdash;in fact, it had the appearance of being
a very disorderly rabble; I understand when the
Empress died it was regarded as such a danger
that those in authority put the broad Yangtsze
between them and a possible mutiny.
</p>

<p>
The real danger to China as regards foreign
relations is that her bad finance or her own want
of discipline may bring about a state of internal
disorder which may compel the interference of
foreign powers.  Last year this nearly did happen.
Two regiments mutinied and seized a town on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
Yangtsze; they stopped all communications with
the outside world, and to all intents and purposes
were in a fair way to commence a rebellion.  Close
by them were several other regiments who might
be expected to throw in their lot with them, and
the position was very critical.  The missionaries
inside the town were in fear of their lives, and with
difficulty managed to communicate with the British
Consul and to tell him of their plight.  He ordered a
gunboat to go down, and the presence of the gunboat
intimidated the mutineers.  At the same time the
Governor of the city showed remarkable courage in
going round the town pacifying the mob.  The
authorities were able to move in two other
regiments, who had no sympathy with the mutiny.  The
mutineers were disarmed and the incident closed.
But such an incident may occur at any moment.  The
condition of the country is such that anywhere a
rising may occur, and the fire once alight may be
hard to extinguish; the result of the conflagration
must be that the powers must enter to secure the
safety of their nationals.
</p>

<p>
Altogether poor China is in a dangerous position
in regard to her foreign relations; all round her
echoes the cry, "You must reform or disappear."  Every
railway that is made, every loan that is
floated, every trade that is opened up, bring to
China increased responsibilities in her foreign
relations.  If she by her good government and readiness
to reform can show that she is able to maintain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
order in her own land, and to give to foreigners an
equal security to that they have in any other country,
her empire may endure for many hundred years;
but if she be found wanting at the present time and
the corruption of her officials renders her unable
to maintain order in her country or to fulfil her
financial obligations, a new phase in Chinese history
will be reached, which will, I believe, be of
extraordinary danger to Europe; China will yield to the
military might of the West only to rise again
to dominate those who dominated her.
</p>

<p>
The missionary who looks at these dark clouds
which surround China, the land of his adoption, feels
that there is only one course to take, namely, the
course that he is taking, to try and build up in China
a high tone of morality, founded on religion, which
may enable her to accept necessary reforms and to
put herself abreast of other nations.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<h4>
CHINESE CIVILISATION&mdash;ITS WEAK SIDE
</h4>

<p>
I do not suppose that we can have any conception
of the amount of suffering which goes on at the
present time in China.  The first time we were in
China I had the honour of meeting a Mr. Ede,
who had just returned from distributing food in
a famine-stricken district, and his description was
truly terrible; the young men had walked away
and found work in other districts, but the old
people and the children had to remain.  What had
caused the famine in this case was characteristic
of unreformed China; "China's sorrow," the river
Hoang-ho, had done what it is ever doing, that
is, it had flooded a district.  When you pass over
it, it looks most innocuous.  It is wholly unable, as
a rule, to fill its own vast bed, which is covered
with delightful sands, reminding one more than
anything else of the sea-shore at low tide; but this
sand is what makes it dangerous, for it is not good
heavy English sand, but a light sand which is
called "loess," and when the river comes down in a
flood&mdash;that is to say, when they have rainy weather
in Thibet or the sun shines unduly on Himalayan
snows&mdash;this sand is carried along with the water,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
and it is asserted indeed that the river consists
more of sand than of water; as the river slackens
the sand is deposited and the bed is filled up, with
the result that the next flood, taking the Chinese
unawares, overflows its banks and reduces a huge
district to poverty; they cannot sow their fields
because they cannot see them.  Of course the
authorities should not be taken by surprise and
the banks should be made up, and canals should
be cut to take away the water in case of a flood;
an enlightened Chinese engineer assured me he had
a scheme for raising the level of huge districts of
China by using this peculiar character of the
Hoang-ho and turning its sand and water flood on to bare
places, and he asserted that the results were most
wonderfully successful, and that districts which were
unfertile before, when well washed and covered up
with this loess, became fertile.  Still, however
beneficial a flood may be to the land in the end, its
immediate result is to starve the population who
are flooded out, for they have no reserves of food.
</p>

<p>
In the case already referred to, the country was a
long time under water, because a canal which should
have drained it away was not kept clear.  The
money had been paid, but, as often happens in
China, the work had not been done.  The action
that the authorities took was characteristic of
Chinese government.  China possesses the system
of internal custom-houses&mdash;a system which the
wildest advocate of Tariff Reform would hardly like
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
to see introduced into Europe; these custom-houses
are called "Likin," and are a source at once of a
great deal of profit to the provinces and of
irritation to all traders.  The Chinese used these
custom-houses to engineer a corner in rice by which the
area of scarcity of food was enormously increased
and several officials amassed considerable sums of
money; by the law of China it is illegal to export
rice even from one province to another; this law
was put in force, and the rice supply was cut off;
at the same time early in the famine certain rich
men bought up rice freely, with the result that it
rose to a very high figure, so that round the area
of famine and desolation there was an area of
scarcity and shortage.
</p>

<p>
A large amount of food from all parts of the
world was sent by the famine funds, but it was
very difficult to induce the officials to allow the
food to enter the famine district.  They were filled
with all sorts of scruples.  They were afraid, for
instance, that the steamers towing the barges full
of food on a canal which had not before been opened
for steamers, might excite the hostility of the
population; they were courteous, they were diplomatic,
but they were obstructive; and so it came about
that while there was a famine in one district of
China, in the other districts there was a very heavy
surplus, of which they had difficulty in disposing.
All this did not create the slightest surprise in
those who knew China.  When the story was told
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
us all the old Chinese hands merely said, "How
like China," or "Just like them."  This was our
first insight into what the civilisation of China
means, and therefore for the first time we realised
the problem that is before the world&mdash;the problem
which missionaries, with great devotion, are trying
to solve.
</p>

<p>
Chinese civilisation is not, as many people imagine
it to be, a mere courtesy title for a state in reality
only a degree off barbarism.  Many of my humbler
parishioners, for instance, when we left for China,
ranked the Chinese as something very near cannibals,
and I do not think they would have been in the
least surprised to hear that we had been roasted
and eaten by the natives.  The Chinese have
perhaps a greater right to be called civilised than we
have on this side of the world; their civilisation
dates from eras we are accustomed to call Biblical.
Confucius and Ezra represent contemporaneous
ideas&mdash;ideas that are not wholly different in thought.
While on the other side of the globe civilisation
has been handed from nation to nation, and a
civilised race has become barbarous and a barbarous
race civilised, the Chinese, without making any very
great advance, have steadily proceeded along a path
of progress, and at the present time they possess a
very carefully organised system of society.  On paper
the whole thing is perfect: the Emperor at the top,
the Viceroys over each province, under them the
Prefectures, and so down to the village community
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
in the country or the trade guild in the town.
The system of government is so perfect that they
claim that they are able to discover any individual
wanted among those 400,000,000 of Chinese, unless
his disguise is very perfect.  When we were chatting
over the revolutionaries and talking about a certain
doctor dodging in and out of China at the risk of
his life, I said that I wondered that there was any
difficulty at all for a man who was bred in the
country wandering where he liked, and I was
assured that such was the organisation of the
Chinese Government that they could lay hands even
in the remotest village on anybody if they required
him, and that the only way a revolutionary could
hope to escape arrest was by a most perfect and
complete disguise.
</p>

<p>
With this splendid organisation is joined great
solidarity.  The Chinese race are essentially one.  If
it were your duty to look through reports coming
from China, as it has been mine, the first thing that
would strike you would be its essential oneness; you
will not find more difference between different parts
of China than there is between England and Ireland.
I do not for a moment mean to say that there are
no differences between the Chinese&mdash;that would be
untrue; but you will not find such a difference as one
might expect from the diversity of geographical
conditions.  The civilisation is essentially similar.  It is
a civilisation with great merits.  The population is
sober, industrious, and perhaps I might add honest,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
all lovers of China will certainly agree; but if you
are writing, as I am, to people who have never been
out of England, I think you will have to qualify the
phrase with some such a one as "honest as compared
with other Orientals," or "honest when contrasted
with the Japanese."
</p>

<p>
They are also extremely obedient; their idea of
the respect which should be paid to authority far
exceeds that which prevails on this side of the globe.
I think we may add with truth that great numbers
of them are very loyal to their employers.  But when
this much has been said, the dark side of their
civilisation must be added&mdash;it is essentially corrupt
and cruel; the ideas of honour, purity, mercy are
but too little understood.  Missionaries assured us
that there was no word for purity that could be
applied to a man, while the same word stands for
honesty and stupidity.
</p>

<p>
Yet this nation is in many ways well fitted for
the mechanical age in which we live.  What the
owner of the factory wants is an industrious, sober,
and obedient man, and he does not want, or at least
does not realise that he wants, an honourable, pure,
and merciful man.  The Chinaman will be in his
element in the factory; the long hours of monotonous
toil will not be unpleasant to him; he is always
sober&mdash;in fact, he is by nature and culture the ideal factory
hand; and yet this is what constitutes his danger.
He will tend to introduce into Europe the vices which
are now desolating his own country, unless, indeed,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
the European teacher can help him to eradicate those
vices.
</p>

<p>
I have given you some idea of his corruption by
the story told at the beginning of this chapter, but
we heard many others all to the same effect.  We
went up the Yangtsze in one of the China Merchants'
boats with an old Swedish captain who liked the
Chinese and rather disliked the missionaries, so his
evidence was not biassed by any wish to prove that
our civilisation was more perfect than that of the
Chinese.  We asked him why it was that he being
a European should be captain of a ship that was
owned by Chinese, and largely used by them.  He
told us that the Chinese merchants had once tried
to have a Chinese captain, but the moment the ship
reached the first port of the Yangtsze, the custom
officers were on board rummaging here and rummaging
there.  Very soon a large amount of contraband was
found on the ship, put there with the knowledge
of the captain.  The consequence was the ship was
fined and delayed.  They tried Chinese captains
again and again with the same result, and so they
have been reduced to employ Europeans to secure
honourable officers.  He, however, had to confess that
the Chinese distrusted the sobriety of the European
officers, and assured us that the old comprador on
board, one of whose duties apparently was to look
after the passengers and take their tickets, was in
reality a spy on them.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best instance of the corruption of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
Chinese is their action with regard to the currency.
In the good old days the currency of China was the
silver shoe or ingot, which had no exact weight, and
had therefore to be weighed at every transaction.
Below that was the copper currency, which had no fixed
relation to the silver currency, but only the relation
of copper to silver.  A copper cash, therefore,
represented only its actual value in copper.  It was
naturally a most unwieldy coin.  The old books of travel
in China give lamentable pictures of the traveller
riding about with huge strings of copper cash almost
crushing him with their weight.  When the whites
began to trade in China they introduced the Mexican
dollar with its subsidiary coinage, and this was the
common currency in all the ports until a few years
ago; but when the Chinese began to Westernise they
considered it inconsistent with their dignity not to
have a coinage of their own.  Led by the Japanese,
and assisted by several firms whose speciality was
the erection of mints and mintage machinery, they
started mints all over the country, and they have
kept these mints busy with the most <i>funeste</i> results.
To begin with, they coined a dollar in imitation of the
Mexican dollar, but even in this the mints did not
agree.  Some dollars are very light, some slightly
below value, and some are nearly true.  The first
experience of the traveller is that he possesses in his
pocket a set of coins which no one will accept, except
at a great reduction.  But the muddle goes further
than that.  It was very profitable coining light coins,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
but it was still more profitable to do so in the lower
denominations.  The Chinese thought, or chose to
think, that it did not matter what the intrinsic value
of a 10-cent piece was as long as you wrote on it
10 cents.  They have no bank or post-office where
you have a legal right to get a dollar for ten 10-cent
pieces, and the result therefore of recklessly coining
the base 10-cent pieces has been not only to
depreciate it with regard to the dollar, but to make
it an uncertain value, so that you must go to the
money exchangers almost every morning and ask
for the rate of exchange between the dollar and
the small silver pieces.
</p>

<p>
Of course at every step on this downward path the
officials concerned made a great deal of money; their
next step was to deal with the copper coin in the same
way, so now there is no fixed relation between the
copper coinage and the silver coinage, nor between
the large copper and the small, and this is still
further confusing, as the provinces having different
mints have dollars of different values.  And now I
hear that they have begun to make money by debasing
the old silver shoe coinage, which, though it is sold
by weight, used to have a certain standard of purity,
and they have issued cash which have no intrinsic
value at all, and that do not represent the fraction
of a coin having any intrinsic value.  The result of
this currency "Rake's Progress" has been to
produce what corruption always does produce&mdash;widespread
poverty.  Everybody cheats.  The stationmasters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
along the line assure the European superintendents
that the fares are always paid in the most debased
coinage, and it is very hard to deny the probability
of this.  But of course the stationmasters take care
if any coin comes to their hand which is not debased
to do a bit of exchange on their own account.
</p>

<p>
If Chinese civilisation is corrupt, it is also cruel,
not with the wild tempestuous cruelty of the savage,
but with the cruelty of the civilised man who at once
uses human suffering as the best engine for human
government, and never cares to cure it unless he has
some pecuniary object in view.  The Chinese are inured
to pain, and some people argue that they do not feel it
to the same degree as Western nations.  No doubt
the sensation of pain is intensified in people of highly
developed nervous organisation, and the Chinese have
a nervous organisation of a very quiescent kind.  I
remember, when we first landed at Hong-Kong, being
struck by a Chinaman who had chosen as his bed
for his midday siesta an ordinary piece of granite
curbing; and as you go along in the train every
freight car that you pass has some one sleeping on
it to protect it from robbery, and a truck of coals or
a load of stone is obviously regarded as a most
comfortable resting-place.  Some of the doctors
maintained that this was the case throughout their
nervous system&mdash;they were insensitive to pain;
others said that pain, like everything else, is a thing
to which you can get accustomed, and that pain has
played so large a part in their lives that they are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
accustomed to it, and are not therefore afraid of it.
Take, for instance, the foot-binding of the women;
every family in China must be accustomed to hear
the sobs and cries of the little girls as they are going
through the first stages of foot-binding.  Or take
again the public flogging; all the working classes of
China must be quite accustomed to the idea that
men are flogged for certain offences till their flesh
is of the consistency of a jelly.  A doctor, describing
the state in which men are brought into the hospital
after such floggings, said that it was a difficult matter
to avoid mortification setting in, and it was only with
very careful treatment that they could be cured, the
whole flesh having to slough away, being absolutely
crushed and battered.
</p>

<p>
Yet this strange people are so indifferent to
these horrors, that even those who suffer will laugh
amidst their sufferings.  We were told the following
tale, whether true or not I cannot say.  A man was
being bambooed for an offence, and astonished the
officials by laughing all the time; the more he was
flogged the harder he laughed, till at last those who
were punishing him stopped to ask him the reason
of his mirth.  "You have got the wrong man," he
said.  It is always a comfort to have a keen sense
of humour.
</p>

<p>
I do not think there is anything more awful than
the descriptions one has as to the indifference to
suffering that is displayed by the average Chinaman.
I remember a story told me by a sailor.  As a ship
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
was being loaded, a man, obviously on the verge of
death, came and asked for work, but failed to get it.
Shortly after he was seen hanging about the ship,
and at night they found him lying between some
bales.  He was turned out, but he constantly crept
back, first to one place, then to another, till at last
the sailor came to know his face quite well.  One
day, as the sailor went ashore, he was attracted by
a little crowd looking at something, and this proved
to be the poor fellow in his death struggle, lying in a
gutter of water.  He called the attention of a Chinese
policeman to him.  The Chinese policeman explained
that he would move him when he was dead, as he
had orders to remove all corpses, but that he could
not move him while he was alive.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Macklin of Nanking told us story after story
of the way in which the Chinese would leave people
in a dying condition on the road.  A little time ago
he had ridden into an old temple, and there he saw
a man apparently asleep, but on looking at him more
closely, he saw that his eyes were wide open and
that the flies were walking right across his eyeballs,
showing that he was quite insensitive.  He called
to one or two men and asked them to help him to
carry this poor sufferer to some house near, but they
could not or would not find a house to keep him in;
and so in the end Dr. Macklin determined to take
him straight back to Nanking, which he did.  There
he administered a very heavy dose of quinine
hypodermically, with the result that the man soon showed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
signs of returning consciousness.  It was a case of
malignant malaria, and had he not been found by
Dr. Macklin, the man must have been eaten by wild
dogs or have died from the disease; as it was he
recovered, and proved to be a hard-working young
farmer who was in search of work, as his home had
been ruined by a local failure of crops.  He had
apparently contracted malaria, and owing to his
poor and ill-nourished condition it had gone hardly
with him.

<br />
CHINESE CIVILISATION: ITS BAD SIDE&mdash;AN OLD BEGGAR. ITS GOOD SIDE&mdash;A GARDEN
</p>

<p>
But story after story was told us always to
the same effect&mdash;that the quality of mercy is not
highly esteemed by the Chinese.  The appeal the
beggar makes to you as he runs after you is the
old Buddhist appeal, which after all is essentially
selfish, as he beseeches you "to acquire merit" by
helping him; we must remember that even this
reason for mercy is despised by the gentry and
literati of China as essentially belonging to Buddhism.
Perhaps the most lurid stories that we heard were
up river.  One came from the country of the Lolos.
The Chinese were going out to fight the Lolos, and
the missionary saw them carrying a handsome young
man bound on a plank so that he could not
move&mdash;so bound that his head was thrown back.  After
certain ceremonies they cut the man's throat, and
scattered the blood on the flags; it was a sort of
human sacrifice.  Another story we heard from some
devoted Franciscan Sisters up at Ichang.  They
assured us that if a mother found her children
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
weakly, and she lost one or two, she would make
up her mind that the reason they were ill was
because an evil spirit had a grudge against her.
She would then take one of her remaining children,
and, in the hope of propitiating the evil spirit, she
would burn that child alive.  We could not believe
this story was true; but that evening we saw
some hard-working Presbyterian ladies, common-sense
efficient Scotchwomen, and they assured us that it
was quite true.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<h4>
CHINESE CIVILISATION&mdash;ITS GOOD SIDE
</h4>

<p>
It would give a very false idea of the Chinese if great
stress were not laid on the good side of their
civilisation.  They have many fine qualities, and in more
than one point they are superior to the nominal
Christianity of some Western countries.  The first
thing perhaps that strikes a foreigner when he is
brought into contact with the Chinese is their great
courtesy; their literati are such gentlefolk.  Even the
less cultured people have most refined manners; no
one is ever rude; and one of the things they cannot
understand is how we can esteem a rough, frank, honest
man.  There is a case when they would not appoint
a certain Englishman to a commercial post, preferring
a man of far less attainments and of much shorter
service, because the former was rude.  That was
enough.  It was no use telling them that his honesty
was above suspicion, that he was a reliable business
man, that he was very hard working, that he had
many years of hard service behind him; they allowed
all this freely, but they shrugged their shoulders and
said, "The truth is, he is such a rude fellow, and he
will give such very great offence by his bad manners,"
so they would not have him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
</p>

<p>
When a visitor enters a Yamen, he realises that his
manners must be those of a most polished diplomat.
Before him walks a servant, holding aloft his visiting
card.  One really ought to have special Chinese cards
printed on beautiful sheets of red paper with
queer-looking characters on them setting forth one's rank
and name.  However, in these days of admiration of
the West, our poor little white cards are considered
adequate.  The Viceroy or official meets the visitor,
enthusiastically shaking his own hands&mdash;the Chinese
salutation&mdash;and bowing low; the particular door at
which he meets his guest marks the amount of respect
he wishes to pay him, and is therefore of some
importance.  In my case, when my host was favourable to
higher education, I was received in the outer court.
At every door there was a polite contest as to who
should go through it first, and at last we found
ourselves in a room where tea, dessert, champagne, and
cigarettes were offered, although of the two latter
I was unworthy.  Then began the conversation.  I
found less stiffness once I had explained that I came
to gather opinions about a scheme for education.
After the stately interview was over there was an
equally ceremonious leave-taking.
</p>

<p>
Though the methods of the Chinese in doing business
may be exasperating to a Western whose time is
money and who wants them to come to some
immediate decision, they are invariably delightful and
courteous in all their negotiations.  This courtesy is
all the direct result of Confucian teaching.  Stress is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
laid there on courteous behaviour, perhaps even to
a degree which may strike the Western traveller as
absurd.  This courtesy, I understand, extends even
to those of lower degree.  Your servant in speaking
to another calls him brother, and nothing makes
the servant despise his master so much as seeing
him lose his temper: it is to his mind a mark of our
savagery.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese have higher virtues than courtesy.
They are essentially industrious.  You have only to
look at a Chinaman's garden to realise the extent to
which he possesses this quality.  I am certain that
those people who are proud of the culture of their
kitchen gardens would be surprised and ashamed if
they could compare them with those of a Chinaman.
One passes garden after garden with rows of
plants placed at even distances and every plant
exactly the right distance in those rows, with never
a weed to be seen all over the whole plot.  Again
in handicraft there is the same industry; you buy
Chinese embroidery for a song in such a place as
Changsha.  No one will tell you that Chinamen ever
object to length of hours; they are ideal men for work
that needs care and accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Again they are very patient.  A monotonous task
is not at all unpleasing to them.  An acute French
observer used the word <i>routinière</i> in describing this
characteristic.  Even in intellectual work this liking
for monotonous repetition will show itself.  One of
the doctors told us that he had the very greatest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
difficulty in inducing his pupils not to perpetuate his
most casual gestures when he was demonstrating.
For instance, when teaching bacteriology, quite
unconsciously he might from time to time put an
instrument down on the table, and just touch it again.
Months after he would find one of his pupils when
doing the same experiment repeating every gesture
he had accidentally made with careful imitation.  It
was clear that the student had monotonously
continued to practice these gestures for no other reason
but that he had seen his master make them.  All
those words which our writers on social subjects are
so fond of inditing against the modern factory system
have no meaning to the Chinaman.  Those complaints
about long hours at mechanical work rendering the
worker little better than a machine are doubtless true
of the white race, but are quite beside the point as
applied to the Chinese.  If the Chinaman is well paid
in the factory he will prefer rather than otherwise
that the work should be mechanical; he will not mind
if the hours are long.
</p>

<p>
Again, he is cheerful and contented under very
adverse circumstances.  When we were being rowed
in a native boat up the Yangtsze, and the men were
straining every nerve against the current, while they
were chilled by a drizzling rain, there was never a
word of discontent; they were always cheerful and
bright, good-tempered and merry.
</p>

<p>
Their highest quality is obedience, which is the
result of their Confucian culture.  The central virtue
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
of that teaching is obedience to parents, and they
hold that doctrine to a degree which to the Western
mind seems exaggerated.  One of the grown-up sons
of a Chinese clergyman did something which he
considered unbecoming in a Christian; to the surprise of
the missionary, he did not hesitate to administer a
sound thrashing to his son, which the young man
took without the slightest resistance, and in this
action the clergyman was supported by the public
opinion of the congregation.  This quality gives to
China its great power, and it is one of the points in
which there is the greatest divergence between the
teaching of the West and of the East.  Every
Chinaman points out to you how little Westerns care for
their parents.  I remember a Chinese gentleman
explaining in a patronising way to the other Chinese
that, strange though it seemed, he knew it as a
fact that one of the commandments of our religion
really was that we should honour our parents.
</p>

<p>
Were it not for this principle of obedience which
is implanted in the mind of every Chinaman, the
government of China would scarcely endure for a
day; but he is taught from his earliest youth to
obey his father, not as we teach in the West
because the child is unable to think and understand,
so that obedience to parents is a virtue which must
fall into disuse as knowledge increases, but as an
absolute duty, a duty equally incumbent on a man
of forty as on a child of four.  This principle is
extended to that of civil government; the local
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
official is in their quaint phrase "the father and
mother of his people," and the obedience to parents
taught in childhood is therefore extended to those
who govern.  No Chinaman has any doubt but that
the first duty of man is obedience to authority.  Let
us hope these qualities will ever endure.
</p>

<p>
What may happen, and, alas, I am afraid, is at the
present moment happening, is that the two civilisations
may be so blended together that the qualities
of each may be lost and its peculiar virtues destroyed
while its characteristic vices are preserved.  The
great qualities of obedience to parents, of courtesy to
strangers, are being forgotten.  The Chinaman
educated in the States is rude and abrupt; he fancies that
it is Western and business-like.  Every Chinese
gentleman to whom I talked, allowed that one of the worst
results of Western teaching had been that a Westernised
Chinaman was less obedient and respectful to his
parents.  On the other hand, the Westernised
Chinaman does not acquire the peculiar virtues of the
Englishman.
</p>

<p>
The superficial Chinese thinker wants China to
learn only the material side of our civilisation, to
profit by our mechanical excellence without learning
anything of our ethics.  His view is that the West is
immoral but wealthy; he regards Europe as the place
where there is no principle excepting money-worship,
and therefore he argues that if you would Westernise
China you must despise morality and seek for money.
Chang-Chih-Tung voiced this thought when he said,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
"Western education is practical, Chinese education is
moral."  If you try to argue with a thoughtless
Chinaman who has perhaps never left China, and
whose only experience of Western life is what he has
seen in a treaty port, you will find that it is hard to
convince him that Western education produces a high
moral tone.  After all we may, to a certain extent,
be to blame for their want of appreciation of the
morality of the West, for too often we show to the
Chinese a very degraded side of our civilisation; and
though I do not think that Shanghai at the present
merits the term that was applied to it fifty years
ago of being a "moral sink," yet undoubtedly the
treaty ports, both by their constitution and by their
geographical position, collect very unpleasant
specimens of white civilisation.  There are a certain
number of men who spend a great part of their
existence being deported from Shanghai to
Hong-Kong, and from Hong-Kong to Shanghai.
</p>

<p>
One of the comedies in the tragedy of the
extinction of the independence of Korea is illustrative
of this point.  The Emperor of Korea heard that the
Western races were far more trustworthy than those
of the East, and so fearing assassination after the
murder of the Queen, he determined to enrol a corps
of Europeans as a body-guard; he sent over officers to
Shanghai with orders to enlist Europeans.  Unfortunately
for himself he did not take the precaution of
sending with them any Western to help in the
selection of the men.  To Korean eyes all Westerns
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
look alike, and as they were offering good pay, they
soon had their corps complete; they returned to Seoul,
and the corps was installed with suitable uniforms,
and, alas, rifles and ammunition.  The moment the
corps was paid, the greater bulk of them got drunk,
and for the next few hours Seoul was distinctly an
undesirable place of residence, filled with drunken
men of all nationalities shouting and shrieking and
firing loaded rifles recklessly in every direction.  The
poor Emperor trembled as he looked from his palace
windows at his body-guard out on the drink, and he
made up his mind that it would be better to take
a reasonable chance of assassination by the Japanese
than to risk the danger of being guarded by this
inebriate troop of Westerns.  With the help of the
Consul the body-guard when sober were returned to
Shanghai, and let us trust the Chinese heard the
story and were convinced that in accepting Western
civilisation they must be careful to avoid accepting
the vices of the West.
</p>

<p>
At Changsha I heard a similar story, but with a
tragic side, which one felt exonerated the Chinese for
being rather incredulous as to the morality of our
civilisation.  Changsha, I should explain, is reputed
one of the most bigoted cities in China; even at the
present moment white women are advised not to walk
through the streets.  The Hunanese have a bold
independent character, which makes them rather
hostile to any foreigner or to foreign ways, and I am
afraid that the story I am going to repeat will have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
confirmed them in their conviction that foreigners are
undesirable.  Two white men belonging to one of the
South European races&mdash;Greeks, I think&mdash;settled
themselves down in defiance of treaty rights in Changsha,
and at once opened a gambling hell.  Very soon they
taught the Chinese, who are as a race very addicted
to gambling, new and most pernicious forms of that
hateful vice.  The Governor complained to the Consul;
the Consul sent his officer down, accompanied by the
police, to arrest the Greeks; the Private Secretary to
the Governor informed the Consul of the tragedy that
followed.  The Consular officer warned the Greeks that
they must give up their gambling establishment and
go back to Hankow.  They said they would not.  He
told them that if they refused he would arrest them,
take them to the boat, and send them down by force
to Hankow.  They still refused, and he advanced, upon
which one of the Greeks shot the officer dead.  The
Chinese police after their manner vanished, while the
Governor's Private Secretary, according to his own
account, spent most of the time of the interview under
the table.  The Greeks, seeing the coast clear, and
realising that vengeance must come, took to the open
country.  The Chinese were told to arrest them
if they could.  Of course they had no difficulty in
finding them, but to arrest them was a different
matter.  They mobilised two or three regiments, and
surrounding the house in which the Greeks had taken
refuge, they kept on firing at long range till they
judged, from there being no signs of life, that they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
must have killed them.  They then carried off the
bodies, but thought it better to describe the incident
in an official document as a case of suicide from fear
of arrest, lest they should be held responsible for
the death of these murderers.  The next Greeks that
came up the river were sent down with a guard of
forty men, and so terrified were the Chinese that they
had to put them first-class, as no Chinese would have
dared to have travelled with them.
</p>

<p>
There were several other stories told at Changsha
to the same effect.  The European that the Chinaman
sees in that sort of place is too often one of those
worthless men who has found his own country
impossible to live in, and who hopes that his vices and
crimes may escape unnoticed in distant China.  Can
one wonder that the Chinese are liable to misunderstand
the West, and were it not for the saintly life of
many missionaries, the high character and strict justice
of our Consuls&mdash;yes, and the admirable discipline and
management of such great undertakings as that of
Butterfield and Swire&mdash;the evil would be incurable;
but though there are many specimens of the bad,
there are also not a few men who by their lives have
testified before the Chinese to the greatness of our
social and moral traditions and to the religion by
which they are inspired.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<h4>
RAILWAYS AND RIVERS
</h4>

<p>
The rivers and railways of China form a very marked
contrast.  The rivers represent the old means of
communication, the railways the new, and the
comparison between the river and the railway enables
the traveller to compare new with old China and to
realise the great changes that are taking place there
and the transitional character of the phase through
which the country is now passing.
</p>

<p>
Ancient China, as compared to ancient Europe,
was a most progressive country, a very essential point
to remember when we have to consider what will be
the attitude of the Chinese with regard to modern
progress.  Theoretically they have always been
progressive; practically they have passed through an age
of progress and reached the other side.  That age of
progress improved very much their means of
communication.  China is naturally well endowed with
rivers, and those rivers were infinitely extended by a
system of canals.  Of these the Grand Canal is the
most perfect example.  The traveller cannot sail
along the Grand Canal and look at the masonry
walls of that great work, or the high bridges that
span it, without realising that in its time it was one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
of the greatest works the world had ever seen.  That
canal, typical of modern China, is now in disrepair,
but the spirit of the men who built it is not gone;
it is the same spirit that now welcomes railways all
over China.
</p>

<p>
The greatest of China's natural waterways is the
Yangtsze-Kiang; it cuts right through the centre of
China from the sea to Chungking and further; it
has many important tributaries, which lead through
great lakes and afford a very useful means of
communication to vast districts in Central China.
</p>

<p>
Along that great river for six hundred miles, ships
of the largest size can sail in the summer; battleships,
though not of the largest class, can ascend to Hankow.
Beyond Hankow the river is much shallower, and
communication with Ichang is often interrupted in
the winter by want of water.  A thousand miles
from the sea begin those wonderful gorges of the
Yangtsze which are among the greatest wonders of
the world.
</p>

<p>
Up to Ichang, the Yangtsze is still a big, rather
dull yellow river, a vastly overgrown Thames, a mass
of sandbanks, running through almost consistently
uninteresting country; but after that thousand miles,
it develops into a sort of huge Rhine.  The river
is still yellow, but it runs through green mountains
and grey rocks.  At times it swirls along with an
oily surface dented here and there by whirlpools
which tell of some sunken rock; at other times the
grey rocks creep closer together and the yellow
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
Yangtsze foams itself white in its effort to squeeze
through the narrow opening left.  In quieter reaches
of the river a house-boat or luban can be rowed or
sailed.  The rowing is rather jerky, the sailing
delightful, and so the advance of the traveller is
pleasant and uneventful; but when the boat reaches
the rapids, the only way to get her through is by
towing.
</p>

<p>
There is a temptation always to delay putting
men ashore to tow&mdash;a temptation which ended in
our house-boat being bumped upon a rock.
</p>

<p>
Our captain (we call him "lowdah" in China)
had cleverly devised, by creeping along the side of
the river under shelter of projecting rocks and then
by dodging round the points, everybody shrieking
and yelling as they strained at the oar, to avoid
the necessity of towing; but a more malign whirlpool
than the rest twisted us round till the oars on
one side of the boat could not row because they
were fouled on the rocks, and then another twisted
us sideways on to a submerged rock, and there the
current held us till the police-boat the Chinese
Government supplies to foreign travellers kindly
took our rope ashore and we were hauled off without
apparently having suffered any damage.
</p>

<p>
These police-boats, or "red boats," are a great
feature in travelling on the Yangtsze.  They add
enormously, to begin with, to the artistic effect, as
they are furnished with an art-blue sail, which would
rejoice the heart of an artist, but the nervous traveller
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
regards them with feelings of a warmer nature than
those their æsthetic effect would arouse.  They
guarantee, if not the safety of boats and goods, at
least the safety of his person amidst the terrible
rapids of the river.  If his boat should be wrecked
and his goods become the property of the fishes, he
knows that the "red boat" will dart into the rapids,
and owing to its peculiar construction and the skill of
the boatmen, will be able to rescue and return him, a
washed and grateful traveller, to Ichang.
</p>

<p>
The excitement of passing the rapids is intense.
It is a pleasurable sensation when you watch from
the shore some one else passing through them; it is
more exciting but less pleasurable to be on the boat
itself at that moment.  The excitement is largely
a question of the size of the boat, whence the wisdom
of taking a small boat even if it is less comfortable.
To watch an eighty-ton junk being hauled through a
narrow passage of foaming water is intensely thrilling.
It is a matter of great difficulty owing to the rocky
nature both of the channel and the shore.
</p>

<p>
The Yangtsze rises and falls some hundreds of
feet in the year, and at low water the banks are a
mass of rough rocks which remind one more of the
sea than of a river.  The men who tow are called
trackers, and they have to climb over these rocks
tugging and straining at the rope while a certain
number of them, stripped to nudity, try to keep the
rope clear of the rocks which constantly entangle it
both on shore and in the water.  It is splendid to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
watch these men as they bound from rock to rock
to disengage the rope from some projecting point, or
as, leaping into the stream, they swim across to
isolated rocks and extricate it from all sorts of
impossible situations.  Meanwhile the junk creeps up
inch by inch, at times standing almost still while the
water surges past her and makes a wave at her bow
which would not misbecome a torpedo-destroyer in
full steam.  Woe betide the junk if the rope should
foul and break in spite of the efforts of these men, for
then she would be at the mercy of the current, and
if it should so happen that there was no wind, the
mariners on board have no command over her, and
she must drift as chance will guide her till quieter
water is reached.  Of course if there is a wind they
can haul up their sail, and then, though they will
descend backwards down the stream, they will do
it with dignity and safety.  We passed a junk doing
this.  Her rope had apparently broken, her huge sails
were set to a stiff breeze; as you watched her by
the water she seemed to be sailing at a good rate
forwards; as you watched her by the land she was
travelling a good steady pace down stream.  If she
cannot hoist her sail because the wind is unfavourable,
then she will rush back, inadequately guided by three
huge strange-looking oars.  The one at the bow, worked
by six men, can twist her round like a teetotum, so
that as she dashes down stream, the captain can
select which part of her shall bump against the
submerged rocks, which after all is but a poor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
privilege, when you remember that eighty tons of
woodwork banged against massive granite rock must
be resolved into its constituent boards, whatever part
of it strikes the rock first.  The two other oars are
even less helpful.  With eight men at each, they can
propel the boat at the rate of about three miles an
hour; but what use is that when the stream is bearing
the junk to destruction at twenty miles an hour.  If
the rope breaks, it is rather a question of good luck
than good guidance.  If there is no rock in the way,
the junk happily sails down and is brought up in
the quieter waters below the rapids.  If there is a
rock in the way, the junk arrives at the end of the
rapid in a condition which would please firewood
collectors but no one else.  Those of the crew who
can swim get ashore, and those who cannot are
either picked up by the "red boat," or if there is
not one there, they disappear; their bodies are
recovered several days later lower down the river.
From a Chinese point of view this is all a small
matter; what is important is that a junk
containing a valuable cargo has been lost.  So
frequent have been these losses that five per
cent. insurance is demanded for cargoes going above
Ichang.

<br />
GORGES OF THE YANGTSZE: AN AWKWARD MOMENT. JUNK NEGOTIATING RAPIDS. (Notice coils of bamboo rope)
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I ought to say one word about the rope
on which the safety of the junk depends.  It is
made of plaited bamboo, which is extraordinarily
light, and does not fray, though it is so stiff that
it behaves like a wire rope.  Its great lightness
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
allows of the use of ropes of enormous length.  I
do not think it is an exaggeration to say that some
of them are a quarter of a mile long.  They are very
strong, and therefore can be of wonderfully narrow
diameter, but apparently they last but a short time,
and every boat is furnished with coil after coil of
bamboo rope ready for all emergencies.  A horrible
accident happens when owing to bad steering the
trackers are pulled back off the narrow ledges cut into
the face of the precipices, which at times border the
river, so that they fall into the rapid.
</p>

<p>
They are an attractive body of men, these trackers.
They leap over the most incredible chasms in the
rocks, they climb like cats up the precipices, they
pull like devils, while one master encourages them
by beating a drum on board the junk, and another
belabours them on shore with a bit of bamboo rope,
which makes an excellent substitute for a birch rod,
and yet withal they are cheerful.  When it rains
or snows they are wet through; when the sun is
hot&mdash;and remember the Yangtsze is in the same
latitude as North Africa&mdash;they expose their bent backs
to the scorching sun; yet apparently they never
grumble, but they wile away the hours of their labour
with cheerful song.  When they row or pull easily,
the song is a weird antiphonal chant&mdash;it seems to be
sometimes a solo and a chorus, sometimes two equally
balanced choruses; but when the work becomes hard,
the song changes into a wild snarl and they laugh
a savage laugh as they strain and sweat to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
uttermost.  I will complete their description by saying
that their views of decency are those of Adam before
the Fall, and that they preserve their strength by a
diet of rice and beans with a handful of cabbages as a
relish.  At night they sleep on the deck of the junk
on their rough Chinese bedding with only a mat
roofing to keep the rain off them.  And as I watched
their cheerful demeanour, I felt more convinced than
ever that the natural virtues of the Chinese are of the
very highest order.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I ought to say one word about the beauty
of the gorges.  I think in two points they excel.  First,
in the height of the massive cliffs, through which the
Yangtsze has cut its way like a knife; the size of the
river and the size of the cliffs are so much in
proportion that the eagle circling above the gorge looks like
a swallow, and the crowd of trackers appears as a
disturbed ant colony.  The other way in which the
gorges excel in beauty is in colouring; at one point
especially it was most remarkable&mdash;the rocks were red,
the mountains when we saw them were purple, and
the purple and red harmonising with the fresh green
foliage of early summer and the deep yellow of the
river, made a rich combination of tints in the
landscape which could hardly be surpassed.  It is typical
of the state in which China is at the present day that
a scheme should be on foot for building a railway
which no doubt will render the gorges of the Yangtsze a
silent highway, and, instead of hearing the wild song
of the tracker or the savage beating of the tom-tom,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
the lonely eagle will circle above a silent river on
which the fisherman's bark alone will sail in the
future.
</p>

<p>
For all schemes to tame the wild and fierce
Yangtsze are clearly impossible.  The river rises and
falls more than a hundred feet with great rapidity,
and no human hand could ever throw a dam across
this mass of surging water.  Possibly it might be
used as a source of power for electrical work, but it is
far more probable that the smaller rivers which fall
into the Yangtsze will be chosen for that purpose.
This district may be a tourist resort, and dwellers in
the plains of China may seek coolness and beauty on
one of the crags that overhang the river; the modern
hotel may perch itself beside the ancient Buddhist
temple; but the days of the river as a great
commercial route of China are numbered as soon as the
railway linking far-western Szechuan to the rest of
China is completed.  One wild scheme proposes that
the railway should come from Russia straight down
from Szechuan, in which case more than probably
Szechuan will fall completely under the influence of
the Russian Government.
</p>

<p>
One of the results of Westernising China must be
to produce an industrial revolution.  All those men,
for instance, who make a living by leaping from crag
to crag, from rock to rock, and swimming, struggling,
rowing in that river Yangtsze will find their living
gone.  But not only will the railway make many poor
who had a competence, but it must make many rich
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
who before were poor.  In this case, for instance, all
those commodities which are now extremely dear in
Szechuan, because of the cost of transit, will fall in
price, and there will be a period when there will be
a wide margin of profit between the cost of importation
and the conventional price the people are used
to pay, and those who live by trade will grow rich.
</p>

<p>
What has happened in the West must also happen
in the East.  The introduction of steam did not make
the official classes or even the working classes
immediately rich.  The people who immediately
profited by improved means of production and
communication were the great middle class; afterwards
as the working class realised that the margin of profit
would allow of larger wages, they compelled the
masters to share these advantages with them.  So it
will probably happen in China.  With the railway
will come a rich middle class who will be a factor of
growing importance in future China.
</p>

<p>
A great contrast between the Yangtsze and its
wild gorges is the great trunk line from Peking to
Canton which runs at right angles through the
Yangtsze north and south, and must make Hankow,
the place where it crosses the Yangtsze, one of the
greatest cities in the whole world.  The railway is
only completed as far as Hankow.  It runs from
Peking right across the plains of China, which are so
desolate in the spring and so fertile in the summer,
and which depend for their fertility on the July rains.
At every station a great Chinese inn is erected&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
is to say, a big courtyard with rooms round.  At
first, of course, trade was small; the Chinese village
community has but little that it wants either to buy
or sell; each community is to a great extent
self-supporting.  A farmer reckoned, I was told by a
Chinese official, that if he had made 30s. a year,
he had done well.  That does not mean that he lived
on 30s. a year, though in a country where men are
paid threepence a day, one would almost have been
ready to believe it; but it means that he had fifteen
dollars a year to spend on things outside his daily
food.  His farm supplies him with food and drink
and his vicious luxury, opium; his women make his
clothes; it only remains for him to buy material for
the clothes and the little extras that they cannot
make, besides salt.  He pays for the few things that
he has bought, probably with the opium he
produces, or in Manchuria with beans; but the trade has
been of microscopical dimensions owing to the
difficulties of transit.
</p>

<p>
When the railway is made he finds at the railway
inn the Chinese merchant ready to buy and sell
anything that he on his part is ready to trade.  At
first, such things as sewing cotton and cigarettes are
the things that are traded against silk or opium, and
then comes Chinese medicine and mineral oil, and so
trade begins, and soon the Chinese inn becomes a
market-place, and the railways begin carrying goods.
</p>

<p>
Of course the full development of the railway
system must depend on the feeding lines and in what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
we had in Europe before the railway system, and
what the Chinese have not got, the feeding roads.
In Manchuria&mdash;for China, like England, is more
go-ahead in the north than in the south&mdash;they are
already moving in this direction.  The Russian
railways, possessed now by the Japanese, are very busy
carrying beans to Dalny, and soon the Japanese lines
from Mukden to Antung will be equally busy, and
the line from Mukden to Tientsin also will carry this
crop.  What they are now considering at Mukden
is how they can arrange a feeding system of light
railways, by which a bigger area of ground can be
brought within reach of the railway system.  To
give some idea of the energy and progressive character
of the officials in those parts, I may mention that they
are already making inquiries as to the mono-rail
system for such railways.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese have made up their minds to welcome
railways, and though they would far prefer railways
to be built with Chinese capital, they are of necessity
compelled to accept European capital, since their
fellow-countrymen want very high interest for their
money.  The Germans have taken very full
advantage of the Chinese desire for railways, and have
linked Kiauchau with the railway system of China.
</p>

<p>
The effect of all this must be very far reaching.
To begin with, it will alter the influence of foreign
powers.  As the railway service is completed, Kiauchau
will become a very much more important centre than
it is now.  If a railway that links Peking to Nanking,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
or, to be accurate, to a town on the Yangtsze
opposite to Nanking, is cut by a railway from
Kiauchau, the result will be that Kiauchau will
become the nearest ice-free port for an enormous
district of China.  This cannot fail to strengthen the
German influence, and the German influence is
connected, as we have already explained, too much with
that political side of missions which has caused
them to be distrusted by peace-loving Chinese.  The
Chinese will ask themselves, will there not soon be
a missionary incident which will justify a further
aggression by Germany along the railway, which lies
so handy for a military advance, and they will be
suspicious of any German missionary effort in that
quarter.
</p>

<p>
But the effect of the railways is much more far
reaching than any casual advantage that it may give
to various powers, whether it be to Germany in
Shantung, or to Russia or Japan in Manchuria, or
to France in Yunnan, or to Russia in Szechuan.  It
will have two main effects.  First and foremost it
must place the whole of China in the same position
that Shanghai and Tientsin occupy at the present
moment&mdash;that is, it must make the whole of China
a mixture of Eastern and Western civilisation.  It
may be urged that the rivers of China have already
been the means of bringing East and West into close
contact with one another, and yet that China remains
still a separate and different country to the treaty
ports.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
</p>

<p>
The answer is, firstly, that it is comparatively
only a short time since the river has been opened to
foreign trade, and that a great advance has been made
in the treaty ports, so much so that a man in the
customs service living by the gorges of the Yangtsze
described the difference between the treaty ports and
the rest of China by saying, "A man who has only
seen Shanghai and Hankow has never seen China."  Secondly,
a railway has a great educational effect.
When a railway is first opened the Chinese crowd
to see it; they get in the way of the engine, they
are run over, they accuse it of malign powers, and
then they come to the conclusion that it is after
all only a machine, and they take readily to travelling
by rail.
</p>

<p>
For instance, the railway from Tientsin up to
Manchuria has already completely altered the
conditions of culture in the north.  It has enabled a
large number of labourers to migrate every year to
cultivate the fertile but icy districts of Manchuria,
so that it is quite a sight to see truck-load after
truck-load of farm labourers travelling like cattle,
going up from the south to the districts of the north
at the rate of three dollars for a twenty-two hours'
journey.
</p>

<p>
Not only does the railway carry the Tientsin
labourer in a truck to the Manchurian beanfield, but
it also carries first-class the Chinese merchant who
will buy the crop of beans to the advantage of the
farmer and to his own greater advantage.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
Chinese are rich in traders, and such an opportunity
would never be allowed to pass.  Every year will
produce a greater number of wealthy Chinese
merchants, many of them very ignorant both of Western
and Eastern knowledge, but probably some of them
owning a respect for that knowledge whose lack they
have felt in proportion to their own ignorance, for
there is no man more inclined as a class to endow
educational institutions than he who in his youth
has felt the need of them.
</p>

<p>
China now needs help to found a University
teaching Western knowledge.  Once it is formed, there
is every reason to believe that it will be endowed by
the same class that has endowed similar institutions
in our own country.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<h4>
THE CITIES Of CHINA
</h4>

<p>
Nowhere is the transitional period through which
China is passing more obvious than in the cities of
China; many towns are still completely Chinese, but
as you approach the ports you find more and more
Western development.  The contrast between towns
is extremely marked.  Shanghai or Tientsin are
Western towns and centres of civilisation; the
difference between them and such towns as Hangchow
or Ichang is very great.  The true Chinese city is
not without its beauty&mdash;in fact, in many ways it is
a beautiful and wonderful place.  But to appreciate
it eyes only are wanted, and a nose is a misfortune.
The streets are extremely narrow passages, which
are bordered on either side by most attractive shops,
particularly in the main street.  The stranger longs
to stop and buy things as he goes along, but the
difficulty is that it takes so much time; he must
either be prepared to pay twice the value of the
things he wants, or to spend hours in negotiation.
There is one curious exception to this rule; the silk
guild at Shanghai does not allow its members to
bargain, and therefore in the silk shop the real price
is told at once.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
</p>

<p>
The shopkeepers are charming, and there are
numbers of salesmen&mdash;salesmen who do not mind
taking any amount of trouble to please.  It is
delightful, if insidious, to go into those shops; and
one can well believe that if a Chinese silk shop
were opened in London, and silk sold at Chinese
prices, the shop would have plenty of customers.
The quality of Chinese silk far exceeds that of the
silks of the West.  A Chinese gentleman mentioned as
an example of this superiority that one of his gowns
was made of French silk, and that it was torn and
spoilt after two or three years; but that he had had
gowns of Chinese silk for twenty years or more which
were quite as good as on the day he bought them,
and that he had only put them on one side because
the fashions in men's garments change in China as
they do elsewhere for ladies.  The same gentleman
related many interesting things about the silk trade.
The quality of the silk is determined by the silk
guild.  This is much more like the guilds in mediæval
Europe than anything that we have nowadays, and
that is why China is not exporting more silk than
she is at present.  These silk guilds to a certain
extent prevent the Chinese catering for European
customers, as they will not allow or at any rate
encourage the production of silks that would take on
the European market.  The West has many faults
as well as many virtues, and one of its faults is that
it no longer cares for articles of sterling value, which
last long and for which a high price must be paid,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
but it delights in attractive articles of poor quality
at a low price.  It is to be feared that the West
may spoil some of China's great products as she has
spoilt the great arts and productions of India.
</p>

<p>
But to return to Chinese streets.  Next the silk
shop will be the silver shop.  Here again the work
is admirable.  At such a place as Kiukiang you can
spend an hour or more bargaining, and watching the
wonderful skill of the silversmiths as they turn out
beautiful silver ornaments.  It is pleasant to wander
along and to look into the shops and see the strange
things that are for sale&mdash;fish of many kinds in one
shop, rice and grain in another, strange vegetables,
little bits of pork, flattened ducks; or to glance at
the clothes and the coats hung out, many of them
of brilliant colours.  The signs over the shops and
the names of the merchants are a feature in
themselves, illuminated as they are in vivid hues of red
and gold, in those wonderful characters so full of
mystery to the foreigner.
</p>

<p>
In a native city up-country the traveller is
practically forced to go through the city in a chair.
There are no wheel conveyances except wheelbarrows,
and, except where there are Manchus, horses are
quite unknown.  Walking is profoundly unpleasant
for a European, for as he walks along he is
constantly jostled by porters carrying loads of goods
on a bamboo across their shoulders; or cries are
heard, and a Chinese Mandarin is carried past
shoulder high, leaning forward looking out of his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
chair perhaps with a smile, of contempt for the
foreigner who can so demean himself as to go on
foot like a common coolie; or perhaps it is a lady
with her chair closely covered in and only a glimpse
to be seen of a rouged and powdered face, for the
Chinese women paint to excess, as part of their
ordinary toilette.  Next comes the water-carrier
hurrying past with his two buckets of water; or
perhaps it is some malodorous burden which makes
a Western long to be deprived of the sense of smell.
But in a chair a ride through a Chinese town is
delightful; the chair-coolies push past foot-passengers
who accept their buffets with the greatest
equanimity, and from a comparatively elevated position
the traveller can look down on the crowd.
</p>

<p>
But when the Chinese city is near a port, all
this begins to change.  The chair is replaced by the
ricksha, and though in many ways it is less
comfortable than a chair, the ricksha is after all the
beginning of the rule of the West, being a
labour-saving machine.  One coolie or two at the most can
drag a man quickly and easily where with a chair
three or four bearers would be needed.  Outside the
old town will be built the new native town, and
the new native town is built on European lines,
with comparatively wide streets.  In a treaty port
the completed specimen of the transitional stage
through which all China is passing is to be seen.
Shanghai is a most delightful town, although it
seems commonplace to those who live there, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
to a stranger it is a place full of contradictions
and eccentricities.  The first thing that strikes one
in Shanghai is that none of the natives know any
of the names of the streets.  It is true they are
written up in large letters both in English and in
Chinese; but as not one of the coolies can read,
they have not the very slightest idea that that is
the name of the street&mdash;they call it quite a different
name; and as they speak a different language both
to that of the educated Chinaman and to the Englishman,
there is no reason why they should ever learn
the names given by them.  The habitual way of
directing a ricksha coolie is by a sort of pantomime,
and there is always a great element of uncertainty
as to whether he will get to his destination even
with the oldest resident unless he knows the way
himself.  I arrived at Tientsin and tried to go and
see Dr. Lavington Hart, whose college is known
all over China, I may say all over the world, but
the Chinese porter was quite unable to make the
coolie understand where it was, and so we wandered
about for some time till the coolie got tired and put
me down opposite what fortunately turned out to
be the house of a Japanese gentleman.  I entered
the house, and was surprised that the Chinese
servant who met me did not altogether seem to
expect me; but as he could not speak English and
I could not speak Chinese, it was impossible to
inquire if anything was wrong.  I was just
wondering why Dr. Hart should live in a Japanese house,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
when the door opened and a Japanese gentleman
walked in.  Fortunately for me he spoke both Chinese
and English well; so after explanations I was again
sent on my road, and found Dr. Lavington Hart
waiting dinner for me, and wondering how I had
got lost.  He then told me that I should have asked
not for his college but for the hospital opposite, and
that I should have asked not for the street but for
the Chinese name of the doctor of the hospital who
had been dead ten or fifteen years.
</p>

<p>
There is a moral in all this: it shows the state
of confusion that exists in small as well as in large
things.  I asked several Englishmen why they did
not accept the native names of the streets; their
answer was that the coolies could not read them;
and when I suggested that common sense would
expect that the coolies' names should be taken for
the streets, for after all that is how most of the
streets in England were originally named, the
suggestion met with no approval.  These small matters
show what a great gulf there is between the thoughts
of the two races.  If the coolies had been Italians or
Germans or Russians, their names would have been
accepted, or they would have been compelled to
learn the new names.
</p>

<p>
Another example of the difficulty of carrying on
the details of city life is afforded by a common
spectacle at Shanghai.  In the crowded streets you
see a little crowd of policemen.  The group consists
of three splendid men, typical of three different
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
civilisations.  First there is the English policeman;
next to him is a black-bearded man, bigger than
the first, a Sikh, every gesture and action revealing
the martial characteristics of his race; then a
Chinaman completes the group, blue-coated and wearing
a queue and a round Chinese hat as a sign of office.
The traveller wonders why this trio is needed till
he sees them in action.  A motor car rushes down
one road, a ricksha comes down another, and a
Chinese wheelbarrow with six women sitting on it
slowly progresses down a third.  All three
conveyances are controlled by Chinamen, and when they
meet, all shout and shriek at the top of their
voices; no one keeps the rule of the road, with
the probable result that the wheelbarrow is upset,
the ricksha is forced against the wall, and the
motor car pulled up dead.  Then the police force
comes into action.  The Chinese policeman objurgates
vociferously and makes signals indifferently to
everybody; the Sikh policeman at once begins to thrash
the Chinese coolie; meanwhile the English
policeman at last gets the traffic on the right side of
the road, quiets his subordinates, sees justice done,
and restores order.  Possibly if the matter had
been left to the Chinese policeman, he would have
arranged it in the end; the traffic in Peking was
controlled entirely by Chinese policemen and was
fairly well managed.
</p>

<p>
There is an extraordinary example of the want
of consideration for the feelings of the Chinese to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
be seen in the public gardens at Shanghai.  There
stands a notice which contains, among several
regulations, first, that "no dogs or bicycles shall be
admitted"; secondly, that "no Chinese shall be admitted
except servants in attendance on foreigners."  Considering
that the land is Chinese soil, one cannot but
wonder that any one who had dealings with the
Chinese should allow so ill-mannered a notice to be put
up.  No Chinese gentleman would object for a moment
if the notice had been to the effect that unclean
persons and beggars should be excluded from the
gardens; but to exclude the cultured Chinese
merchant who is every whit as clean as his Western
neighbour, or to exclude the respectable people of
the middle class whose orderly behaviour is beyond
suspicion, is as unreasonable as it is regrettable.
</p>

<p>
Again, the Shanghai municipality has no Chinese
representatives upon it, though the great bulk of the
population is Chinese, with the result that from time
to time they come across Chinese prejudices and
quite unnecessarily irritate the population which
they govern.  The Chinese have a principle that
a woman shall be publicly punished only for adultery
and open shameless theft; her "face" or dignity must
be preserved; and therefore she should never be made
to answer for her offences in open court, her husband
or her father being held responsible for her behaviour
and for her punishment.  The right way of dealing with
any woman who is charged with an offence is to do as
we do in England with regard to children, to summon
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
not her but those responsible for her behaviour.  I
was assured by a Chinese official that the trouble
which culminated in the Shanghai riots originated
from disregard of this principle.  The refusal of the
Shanghai municipality to have Chinese representatives
upon it is the more remarkable, as I was informed
at Hong-Kong that they have such representatives,
and find them most useful in assisting in the
government of the Chinese.  It is not surprising that
Shanghai is a town to which it is diplomatic to
make no reference in conversation with a Chinese
gentleman.
</p>

<p>
There is more to be said for the mistrust of the
Chinese Post-office and for the continuation of the
curious system by which each nation has its own
post-office.  Nothing is more annoying to the traveller
in Shanghai than the trouble he has to get his letters.
If it should so happen that he has correspondents in
many countries, he has to go to every one of the many
post-offices in Shanghai, and they are situated in
different parts of the town and in places very difficult
to find.  There is the Imperial Chinese Post-office, to
which he first repairs, and where he will find letters
from any correspondent in China; then with the
greatest difficulty he reaches the English Post-office;
after which he remembers that some of his friends may
be on a holiday in France, therefore he must go to the
French Post-office, and so on.  When he asks why
the Chinese Post-office cannot be trusted, he is told
that the Chinese themselves will not trust their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
post-office unless there be a European official in control,
and that the old Chinese system by which letters are
forwarded by private companies still continues in
many parts of China, although they possess branches
of the Imperial Chinese Post-office.  Still the traveller
wearily thinks at the end of his day's journey that
without undue trust in another nationality, or any
loss of national prestige, an International Post-office
might be arranged in a town like Shanghai, with its
vast travelling population.
</p>

<p>
Shanghai with its mixture of races, with its
national antipathies and jealousies, is indeed one of
the most attractive but strangest towns in the whole
world.  Every race meets there; and as one wanders
down the Nanking road, one never tires of watching
the nationalities which throng that thoroughfare.
There walks a tall bearded Russian, a fat German,
jostling perhaps a tiny Japanese officer, whose whole
air shows that he regards himself as a member of
the conquering race that has checkmated the vast
power of Europe; there are sleek Chinese in Western
carriages, and there are thin Americans in Eastern
rickshas; the motor cycle rushes past, nearly colliding
with a closely-curtained chair bearing a Chinese lady
of rank, or a splendid Indian in a yellow silk coat is
struck in the face by the hat of a Frenchman, who
finds the pavements of Shanghai too narrow for his
sweeping salute; one hears guttural German
alternating with Cockney slang; Parisian toilettes are
seen next half-naked coolies; a couple of sailors on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
a tandem cycle almost upset two Japanese beauties
as they shuffle along with their toes turned in; a
grey gowned Buddhist priest elbows a bearded Roman
missionary; a Russian shop where patriotism rather
than love of gain induces the owners to conceal the
nature of their wares by employing the Russian
alphabet overhead, stands opposite a Japanese shop
which, in not too perfect English, assures the wide
world that their heads can be cut cheaply; an English
lady looks askance at the tightness of her Chinese
sister's nether garments, while the Chinese sister
wonders how the white race can tolerate the
indecency that allows a woman to show her shape and
wear transparent sleeves.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Shanghai on a spring afternoon is a most
interesting place; and yet as you turn your eyes to
the river and catch sight of the dark grey warship,
you realise that beneath all this peace and busy
commerce lies the fear of the grim realities of war.
China may assimilate the adjuncts of Western life,
but she will never welcome the Western.  The racial
gulf that divides them is far too deep.  It may be
temporarily bridged by the heroism of a missionary;
the enthusiasm of Christianity may make those who
embrace it brothers; but the feeling of love will not
extend one inch beyond the influence of religion; and
those who ponder on the future as they watch the
many-hued crowd that passes must grow more and
more sure that the future of China lies with the
Chinese alone; and however much as a race they may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
be willing to learn from the West, they will as a race
be led only by their own people.  The Westerner
may be employed; Western teaching may be learnt;
Western garments may be worn; but, as a Chinese
professor said, "The wearer will be a Chinaman all
the same."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<h4>
OPIUM
</h4>

<p>
There was one marked difference in the cities of
China as we saw them in our two visits, and this
was the change that had taken place in the matter
of opium-smoking.  Opium-smoking in 1907 was
such a common vice that you could see men smoking
it at the doors of their houses.  In 1909
opium-smoking hid itself, and those that smoked, smoked
secretly, or at any rate less ostentatiously.  I doubt
whether so great an alteration has taken place in
any country, certainly not of late years.
</p>

<p>
Each race has its peculiar vice; in fact, we may
go further than that, we may say that it is a
remarkable fact that the great bulk of mankind insists
on taking some form of poison; in fact, it is only a
minute minority which wholly abstains from this
practice.  The poisons used by mankind have different
effects and have a different degree of toxic power, but
the reason they are used is because in some way they
stimulate or soothe the nervous system.  Opium,
alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee, hashish, are examples
of this widespread habit of humanity; but these
different drugs have the most different effects on
the welfare of man.  Some seem to be wholly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
innocuous if not beneficial, and others seem to be
absolutely pernicious and to do nothing but evil;
and further than that, one may say that a different
preparation of the same drug or a different way of
taking it produces differing results.  A still more
curious thing is that though all mankind is agreed
in taking some poison, there is a marked, racial
tendency to accept one particular poison and to
detest others, and at times it seems as if the habit
of taking one was sufficient to prevent another
having any attraction.
</p>

<p>
As we went to China we passed through the
Suez Canal, and heard what a curse hashish was in
Egypt, and how the Egyptian Government had
endeavoured to secure total prohibition of the use of
this obnoxious drug, a course which was impossible
owing to the great amount of smuggling that was
facilitated by the wide deserts that surround Egypt.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at Saigon (we were travelling
by the French mail) we first came in contact with
the terrible vice of the Chinese.  A French lady
was pointed out to us by a doctor, and he asked us
to observe the odd glassy look of her eyes, the
intense suavity of her manner and the contempt which
she evinced for truth, and he told us that these were
all symptoms of the vice of opium-smoking that she
had contracted from association with the Annamites.
The French for some mysterious reason seem more
prone to acquire this vice than do our own countrymen,
for though in 1907 it was rife in South China,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
no one ever suggested that any English smoked
opium at Hong-Kong.
</p>

<p>
As we went up to Canton crowds of people were
smoking opium on the Chinese deck, and when we
wandered round they had no objection to our
standing watching the lazy process of dipping the needle
into the treacle-like mixture, turning it round till a
bead was formed, then putting it into the lamp to
light and thence transferring it to the opium pipe,
when after three whiffs or so the process had to be
begun again.
</p>

<p>
The first effect of opium-smoking is to make a
man intelligent and amiable.  It is for this reason
that opium-smoking&mdash;so the Chinese explained to
us&mdash;is used largely in business.  When business is
difficult, and you cannot get three or four men to
agree, the opium pipe is brought out, and after two
or three whiffs the cantankerous people are
reasonable, and the people whose dignity is hurt are
forgiving, and business is easily and rapidly
transacted.  The next stage of smoking is stupidity.  As
you watch an opium-smoker in that condition he
nods amiably at you with a rather imbecile look.
The last stage is one of heavy senseless sleep.  The
habitual opium-smoker rarely passes the first stage,
and its apparently beneficial influence constitutes its
danger.  Each man says to himself: "I will never
take it to excess; I will merely use it and not abuse
it; it makes life sweet to me and business easy."
</p>

<p>
I have always thought that those who condemn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
opium have a tendency to prove too much in their
argument.  If it could be shown that the effects of
opium-taking were invariably pernicious, it would be
very hard to see how the vice could take such a hold
as it has taken on the Chinese race; if the young
men regularly saw that the older men were brought
to inanity and death by the use of opium, they
would themselves be terrified of contracting the
vice, and it would not have spread as rapidly as it
has done.  The vice is essentially modern.  Opium
has only been grown in China for about seventy or
eighty years, and it has only been imported in large
quantities for a scarcely longer period of time.  An
inhabitant of Shansi told us that though every
one smoked opium, and it was a terrible curse,
his father remembered its introduction.  Opium is
certainly deleterious to the moral fibre of a race,
and in many cases it produces death and misery;
but there are a certain number of cases where no
obvious evil effects follow from its consumption&mdash;cases
when as a rule a man is well-nourished, for it acts
most deleteriously on a man's powers of digestion.
Men who have good food can better tolerate the
effects of the drug, so a mission doctor explained,
and their comparative immunity tempts others to
follow their example.  Men do not see at once the
evil that will result, and so its use has spread by
leaps and bounds.  The Chinese Government have
always theoretically resisted it, but their action has
been hampered by their not being permitted to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
prohibit its importation.  For many years the pro-opium
party in China used those treaty obligations by which
China was bound to permit the importation of opium
as a reason for stopping any efforts to extirpate the
vice in the country.  Not only were there always a
great number of people in high places addicted to
the vice, who were naturally unwilling to remove
from themselves the opportunity of its gratification,
but also there was a vast number of people who
rapidly acquired a great pecuniary interest both in
the maintenance and extension of this trade.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for humanity, opium was not only
very injurious but extremely portable, and it
therefore formed in a country where means of communication
are bad a very useful article of exchange.  The
peasant farmer will grow most things on his little farm
which he and his family consume&mdash;in most respects
they will be a self-supporting community&mdash;but there
must be a certain number of things which they will
need to buy, and for which they must give something
in exchange; that something must be portable.  In
many cases the only way of bringing your goods to
the market is by carrying them on your own back.
Opium, alas, forms, in soils which it suits, a most
remunerative crop.  The whole product of several
fields can be carried quite easily on a man's back and
can be sent down to the market, where it will find
a ready sale, and the result of that sale will be
invested in articles of which the farmer and his
family have need.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
</p>

<p>
Not only the farmer, but the trader, both
Chinese and European, find it a most profitable
source of trade.  It was hard, and it is hard, to
persuade the European trader that it is injurious
to China, and to understand the reason we must
turn back to the thought which was suggested at
the beginning of the chapter, namely, that it is
very doubtful whether the English race has any
natural desire for the vice, while it is most patent
that the Chinese have a peculiar national tendency
towards this form of dissipation.  When people have
no desire for an intoxicant themselves, it is hard to
persuade them that others may have a desire which
may be beyond all power of restraint.  The trading
class mixes but little socially with the Chinese, and
the people with whom they are brought in contact
are very generally pecuniarily interested in the opium
trade, and therefore they have neither the evidence
of the Chinese nor of their own temptation to
convince them of the insidious and dangerous character
of this vice to the Chinese race.
</p>

<p>
The English race has long been conversant with
opium.  In the form of laudanum it used to be sold
freely in the eastern counties.  I have heard people
describe years ago how the old women from the fen round
Lowestoffe, or the marshes as they are there called,
would call on market day at the chemist for their
regular supply of laudanum, which they would take in
quantities sufficient to make any ordinary person go
fast asleep.  It was used there, as it is used in many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
countries, as a prophylactic against ague.  The
doctors now deny that it has any beneficial effect,
but the people in the eastern counties used to think
differently.  But when I was a curate at Yarmouth
I could find no traces of this vice; it had apparently
been exterminated not by any social reform or moral
movement, but by the superior attraction of alcohol;
and in my day Yarmouth and the district round was
terribly addicted to the national vice of intemperance.
I noticed the same thing in Shanghai.  The English
know opium; most of them have out of curiosity
tried a pipe; and they describe the effects as trifling
or very unpleasant.  One man said that he felt as if
all his bones were a jelly; another that he felt as if
he was floating between heaven and earth; a third
that he found no pleasure in it at all, but that he
had a "filthy headache" next day.  On the other
hand, if you go into the Shanghai Club you can see
at once what is the attractive vice to the European
at Shanghai; the whole of one side of the entrance
hall was nothing more than the bar of an overgrown
public-house.  You will hear story after story which
tells the same old tale that alcohol, especially in its
strongest form, is the greatest pleasure and the worst
danger to the Englishman abroad as at home.
</p>

<p>
If opium is unattractive to the white man, on the
other hand alcohol is equally unattractive to the
yellow man; in fact, their relative position is much
the same.  The yellow man has known of alcohol
from the very earliest ages.  Dr. Ross quotes the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
second ode of the Book of Poetry as showing how
well known drunkenness was to the Chinese:
"Before they drank too much, they were dignified
and grave; but with too much drink their dignity
changed to indecency, their gravity to rudeness; the
fact is, that when they have become drunk they lose
all sense of order.  When the guests have drunk too
much, they shout, they brawl, they upset the orderly
arrangement of the dishes, they dance about
unsteadily, their caps are set awry and threaten to fall
off, they dance about and do not know when to stop.
Had they gone out before drinking so deeply, both
host and guest would have been happier.  Drinking
gives real happiness only when it is taken in
moderation according to propriety."
</p>

<p>
Drunkenness seems to have been extirpated from
China by the same process that laudanum-taking was
from the eastern counties, namely, it has given way
before the more entrancing vice of opium-smoking.
I was assured that the Tibetans do not share with
the Chinese this preference for opium, and this is all
the more remarkable because from their geographical
position they have always been in close contact with
India, which is apparently the home of the opium
vice, but they have adhered steadily to the vice of
drunkenness.  The Chinese have free trade in drink;
they have no licensing laws; any one may sell alcohol
at any time of the day, in any place they like; and
yet alcohol has so few votaries that you will scarcely
see a drunken man from one end of China to another.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
</p>

<p>
If the English commercial world is incredulous
to the danger of opium to the Chinaman, not so the
Chinese world.  People will tell you that Orientals
love to agree with you in whatever you say, but I
heard a British Vice-consul flatly contradicted by a
Chinese official when the Vice-consul expressed a
doubt as to the danger of the vice, and I must say
the Chinese disputant supported his contradiction
with an argument which seemed to me perfectly
unanswerable.  He said: "Look at the Japanese; they
are impartial spectators of the vice of alcoholism and
opium-smoking; they are conversant with the worst
forms of alcoholism that white men can show them.
It is well known that white sailors are great offenders
in this respect.  Every port in Japan knows what it
is to see a drunken sailor finding his way to his ship.
They are equally conversant with the vice of
opium-smoking.  They have intimate contact with the
Chinese; they know both the recent origin of this
vice and its terrible ravages; and what do they do?
Do they forbid both vices equally?  No; they are so
convinced that opium is so much more dangerous than
alcohol, that they will not allow it to be introduced
into their country for smoking purposes, and the
smuggler is liable to five years' penal servitude.
But the vice of alcoholism they treat as something
which, though harmful, can never threaten their
national existence."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps we who have suffered much more from
the vice of alcoholism than of opium-smoking may be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
inclined to think that while the Japanese are right in
the opium question, they are acting imprudently in
allowing alcoholism to gain such a hold on their
people; but whether they are right or wrong, there
can be no doubt that the Chinese official had justice
on his side when he pointed out that to the Japanese
mind the evils that opium-smoking had done to China
were of a most serious character.
</p>

<p>
His Excellency Tang-K'ai-Sun spoke the Chinese
mind when, in an eloquent speech at the Shanghai
Conference, he told of the awful desolation that
opium was bringing to his land.  But it is
unnecessary to quote the opinion of individual Chinamen;
they are practically unanimous on this subject.  One
has only got to point to what China has done to
show two things.  First, that the curse of
opium-smoking was far greater and more horrible than
anything that we have experienced on this side of
the globe; next, that there is latent in the Chinese
character a vigour and an energy which, when it is
called into action, despises all obstacles and acts so
efficiently as to leave the world lost in astonishment.
Realise what China has done.  China is addicted to
a vice which has a far greater hold upon her than
alcoholism has upon us; she determines that within
ten years that vice is to cease.  The production of
the poppy is to be diminished till none is produced;
opium-smokers are to be held up to public scorn;
opium dens&mdash;which are really the equivalent of our
public-houses&mdash;are to be closed; all officials who take
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
opium are to be turned out of Government employ;
the only exception that is made is for old men, and
that exception was quite unavoidable.  So vigorous
was the action of the Government that men who have
for forty or fifty years of their lives taken opium,
tried to give it up; the result was in several cases
that they were unable to support the physical strain;
a great illness, even death, ensued; and so the edict
was relaxed; men over sixty were allowed to
continue smoking.  When all this was published, every
one smiled.  They argued that China was trying to do
the impossible.  A vice like opium-smoking may be
extirpated, but only after years of struggle.  A
generation must come and a generation must go before
opium or any similar vice shows appreciable diminution.
</p>

<p>
We ourselves have not been unsuccessful in
struggling against the vice of alcoholism; but
consider the number of years since Father Mathew
first spoke against drink.  England may be growing
sober, but it is by slow if steady degrees.  But China
hopes to accomplish in ten years what has taken
England so many patient years of toil to effect
partially.  The idea that China could do this was
regarded by most Westerns as almost laughable.  In
1907, when the edict was first put forth, all those we
met in China held this view; even missionaries, while
they gave every credit to the Government for what
it intended, shook their heads and foretold
disappointment.  We noticed as we passed along that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
wonderful line that links Hankow to Peking and
Peking to Harbin in 1907 that the country was
beautiful with the white and pink crops of poppy,
till at times one might imagine that the transformation
scene of a London theatre was before us rather
than the land of China, and remembering what we
had been told, we also confidently expected failure to
the edict which requires the destruction of so many
miles of this pernicious if beautiful crop.
</p>

<p>
In 1909, when we again traversed the same country,
we could not see a single poppy flower; not only so,
but we made every effort to see if we could find a field.
We went for a twenty mile walk at Ichang through
the country, where no one could have expected a
foreigner to come, and we only found one tiny patch
of poppy, and one in which the ruthless hand of
the law had rooted up the growing crop.  As we
went up the Gorges of the Yangtsze we scanned
with a strong glass the hillside, and never once on
those glorious mountains did we see any sign of
opium cultivation.  We asked about the officials;
not only was the Government enforcing the law that
officials must give up opium-smoking, but they were
taking a more effectual action; they were requiring
all those who were going to be officials to spend some
time under supervision, to ensure that they should
not be opium-smokers.  Could any Western power
hope to accomplish such a feat?  Would the most
extreme temperance reformer suggest that all
public-houses should be closed, that the amount of barley
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
should be diminished every year till within ten years
none should be grown, and that all the Government
officials, from the Prime Minister downwards,
should become total abstainers within that period?
The reason of this vigorous action of China and its
present success is to be attributed to two things:
first, to the terrible and very real national fear that
this vice will destroy the nation, as it has destroyed
countless families and individuals; secondly, to the
vast store of energy which enables China to accept
new ideas and act vigorously on them.
</p>

<p>
The great revolution of thought that is going on
has called forth this vigour.  The China of yesterday
was <i>fainéant</i> and unprogressive.  The China that is
emerging out of this revolution of thought is
energetic, though possibly unpractical.  The old
traditions of Government are not lost, and they wait but
for the man and the hour to enable China to act as
vigorously as she has done in time past.  Her action
in this opium question may be ill-considered in some
details; it may even fail; but it has shown the
world that China is in earnest, and that she can act
with a vigour which will cause wonder and envy on
this side of the world.  Every missionary reports that
even high officials are coming asking to be cured of
the opium habit.  The missionaries have founded
refuges where they receive and cure those who are
ready to submit to the terrible ordeal, for their
suffering is intense.  Many quack cures are advertised.
Some are definitely pernicious; for instance, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
morphia syringe has become a common article for sale
in some parts of China.  Some few may be beneficial.
There is no doubt that the movement against opium
is a great national movement, and is not the result
of the action of any small or fanatical party.  What
China has done proves that this is so.
</p>

<p>
Let me close the chapter by a quotation from the
ablest of the foreign representatives at Peking, Sir
John Jordan.  Writing to Sir Edward Grey, he
says: "It is true that the Chinese Government
have in recent years effected some far-reaching
changes, of which the abolition of the old
examination system is perhaps the most striking instance;
but to sweep away in a decade habits which have
been the growth of at least a century, and which
have gained a firm hold upon 8,000,000 of the adult
population of the empire, is a task which has, I
imagine, been rarely attempted with success in the
course of history; and the attempt, it must be
remembered, is to be made at a time when the Central
Government has largely lost the power to impose its
will upon the provinces.  The authors of the
movement are, however, confident of success, and China
will deserve and doubtless receive much sympathy
in any serious effort she may make to stamp out
the evil."

CHAPTER X
</h3>

<h4>
THE WOMEN'S QUESTION
</h4>

<p>
The desire for radical change is never so much to be
dreaded as when it attacks the home life of a nation.
That quiet life so often hidden away because of its
very sacredness by the Eastern races is like
everything else in China disturbed by the introduction of
Western civilisation, and in no other part of human
life will its two different sides be more apparent.
Western civilisation without Christianity will destroy
the home life as it destroys most Eastern things it
touches, and will do little to construct a new life to
take the place of the one it destroys.  The Japanese
complain that Western civilisation has destroyed
both the modesty and the religion of their women,
and Christianity has not yet been able to any great
extent to reconstruct on the basis of true religion
new ideals of feminine life.  Therefore the Chinese,
with all their enthusiasm for Western culture, are
looking a little nervously at what they see has
happened in Japan.  They say that their home life
is not now unbeautiful; even those who are disposed
to admit that the life of the Western woman is founded
on higher ideals than their own will not allow that
their national home life deserves unmixed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
condemnation.  Everybody agrees that the wanton destruction
of the laws which govern women's life in China may
have a terrible result when Western civilisation is
unwisely introduced, especially if it is made to appear
to be a civilisation without religion.  The missionaries
see in this crisis the necessity for vigorous action;
while thankful for the movement, they realise the
responsibility it puts upon Christians to see that that
movement is wisely directed.  In the memorial from
the Centenary Conference at Shanghai in 1907 to
the Home Churches, they say:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The changed attitude of China towards female
education and the place of woman, lays upon us great
responsibilities.  The uplifting of woman is a first
need in the moral regeneration of a people, and one
of the things in which Christianity has a totally
different ideal from that which the religions of China
have encouraged.  The present change of national
sentiment on the subject is one of the indirect but
none the less striking changes that the slow but
steady dissemination of Christian ideas in China
during the past century has led to.  Let it be
remembered, however, that it requires the Christian
motive power to make it successful and fruitful."
</p>

<p>
It is somewhat difficult to obtain information from
the Chinese themselves as to the position of women.
They are very averse to discussing the subject; in
fact, it is not even regarded as good manners for
a man to ask after the health of his most intimate
friend's wife; and all the information that we could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
get had for the most part to be obtained by Lady
Florence Cecil through feminine sources.  We may
generally state, however, that the position of women
in China is neither so low as that which they occupy
in India or among the Mohammedans, neither is it
in any degree so high as the position of women in
Western lands.  The woman is completely subject
to the man; till she marries she is subject to her
father, when she is married she is subject to her
husband, and if her husband dies she is then subject
to her son, and rarely re-marries.  These are called
the three obediences.  She is not educated as a rule,
because both public opinion and Chinese philosophy
regard her as mentally far inferior to the man.  We
shall explain later on how in Chinese thought
everything is divided into a good and an evil
principle&mdash;a Yang and a Yin.  The woman is distinctly Yin.
She is therefore necessary to man, but at the same
time inferior.
</p>

<p>
Again, with regard to the question of polygamy,
her position is an intermediate one between the
avowed polygamy of Moslem countries and the
ill-maintained monogamy of many a Latin country.
In Hong-Kong the position was explained by a
Chinaman to me thus: that when a woman grew old
it was regarded as her duty to provide a secondary
wife for her husband's pleasure and as a companion
for herself&mdash;a companion with a sense of servitude in
it.  If this was done in an orderly manner, it was
absolutely approved by Chinese public opinion.  If,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
on the other hand, the husband, ignoring the wife's
rights, should choose a secondary wife for himself and
set her up in another house, his attitude would be
regarded as distinctly doubtful by the respectable
Chinese.  In the same way if an official were
appointed to a distant post he would probably not
think of imposing upon his wife with her deformed
feet the pain and discomfort of a long journey; he
would most likely take a natural-footed woman, who
will be for that reason a slave; in fact, one gentleman
went so far as to say that he thought that the
squeezed feet had a great deal to do with this
institution of a secondary wife, because he noted that
the secondary wives of all the officials when they
were travelling were natural-footed women.
</p>

<p>
The secondary wife would be rarely a woman of
good class; it is allowed to be an inferior position.
On the other hand, if she bears her husband a son,
and that son is recognised, all that son's relations,
and therefore all his mother's relations, become
relations of the father.
</p>

<p>
The curious tangle which such a position begets
when brought into contact with the Christian idea
is exemplified in this story.  A rich Chinaman had
three wives.  By his lawful wife he had nine children;
by the other two he had none; but his second wife
was a woman of very strong character, and she was
brought in touch with the missionaries by the
Chinese wife of a European.  She apparently ruled
the house with a kindly rule to which all the others
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
bowed.  She did everything in an energetic and
vigorous way, and she studied Christianity till she
was convinced of its truth, and then she demanded
baptism.  There was a great difficulty; she must
leave her husband before she could be baptized.
After considerable delay she accepted the condition,
but resistance came, not alone from the man, but
from the other two wives.  They could not possibly
get on without her; they were like sisters; and she
must be allowed to return to the house.  She refused,
though the pressure was extreme.  The man said that
he had promised his ancestors that none of his children
should be Christians, and that his own mother would
not forgive him; but the woman held firm, and at
last she was baptized.  Her face was beautiful to
behold while she was accepting Christianity and
renouncing all that made life sweet to her.  The
husband was so moved by her fortitude that he
signed a paper promising not to molest her, and yet
to support her apart, so that she should not be in
any need.
</p>

<p>
At the Shanghai Conference there were, curious
to relate, many women who wished the Christian
body to recognise existing polygamy among the
Chinese.  A sentence of the resolution proposed was
that "secondary wives may be admitted to membership
if obviously true Christians."  Mr. Arnold Foster
resisted the inclusion of these words, and they were
lost.  No doubt the Conference was wise in taking
this line.  It is most essential to maintain the purity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
of the home life, and the difficulty that arises from
secondary wives desiring to join the Christian Church
can never be a very important one, as the vast
majority of Chinese are monogamous.
</p>

<p>
A serious evil this custom creates is that of
female slavery.  Both in Japan and China one of
the awful penalties of poverty is that a man is
sometimes forced to sell his female children.  These
little girls are bought by prudent Chinamen, first
to be servants to their own wives and then to act
as secondary wives to their sons to prevent them
going elsewhere.  Sometimes they are kidnapped by
men who make a regular business of this cruel traffic.
Stories are told of boat-loads of these children being
brought down the Yangtsze, concealed below the
deck and terrorised to keep them quiet by one of
their number being killed before their eyes.  On one
occasion a missionary suddenly saw a hand thrust
through the planks of the deck, and on investigation
he discovered a dozen children hidden below, and as
it turned out they had been kidnapped, not bought,
he was able to get them released.  These slaves are
the absolute property of their owners, and many are
the tales told of the cruel and neglectful treatment
to which they are subjected.  In Shanghai the
Chinese police will report such cases, and in
consequence the ladies of the settlement have founded
an admirable institution to which they can be brought.
The Slave Refuge deserves all support.  There the
little girls are taught and cared for, and helped to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
forget the terrible experiences some of them have
gone through.  Sad to relate, many of them have
to be taken first to the hospital to be cured from
the effects of the ill-treatment they have received.
One poor little thing went into convulsions when a
fire was lit in the ward; it was difficult to
understand the reason, but when it happened again and
the poor child uttered incoherent appeals for mercy,
it was discovered that she thought the fire was lit
to heat opium needles with which to torture her.
Her system was too shattered for recovery, but
many others get quite well and form a pleasing sight
at work and play in the bright cheerful Refuge, with
the happy elasticity of youth forgetting the injuries
which in some cases have left on them permanent
scars.  But I fear the system of slavery continues
very commonly all over China, and such a philanthropic
effort as the Shanghai Slave Refuge can touch
but a very small proportion of them.  Probably when
the little slaves are destined to be wives to their
mistresses' sons they are treated less cruelly, and
though employed as household drudges, do not live
actively unhappy lives.
</p>

<p>
Without stating that women as a whole are
miserable, I think it would be no exaggeration to
say that they are infinitely less happy than their
Western sisters.  Many of the national customs
militate against their happiness.  The custom of child
betrothal, for instance, condemns a woman to live
completely subject to a man for whom she perhaps
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
has the greatest natural antipathy.  Stories are
told of brides committing suicide rather than
leave their father's house to be married to men for
whom they feel no affection; yet as a whole they
accept their position, and a Chinese woman has
neither the will nor the power to be untrue to her
husband.
</p>

<p>
Again, the rule of the husband's mother is very
often extremely harsh; the child-wife is little better
than her drudge.  On the other hand, when a
woman grows older, her position is one of
considerable strength.  I was assured that they
take a keen interest in the management of their
husbands' properties, and often show themselves
excellent business women.  The position which the
late Empress of China acquired shows that women's
position is the very reverse of inferior when dignified
by age.
</p>

<p>
And now before all this woman's world glitters
Western civilisation; the greater dignity which is
accorded therein to women is envied and the laws
which restrain her are misunderstood.  The Chinese
women hear stories of Western life.  At first such
strange perversions are believed as that in the West
women rule.  One missionary explained that this
absurd figment came from the rule of the late Queen;
another attributed it to the custom men have when
travelling in China of walking while their wives
remained in the carrying chair.  To the Chinaman
such a course admits of but one explanation: the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
woman must be greater than the man because she is
carried while he walks.
</p>

<p>
Again, in Western China they learnt through
their local press that girls and boys received a
similar education in England, and they concluded that
the dress must be also similar, and the missionaries
were more amused than scandalised at seeing a
Government girls' school turned out in boys' clothes.
It was explained to us that this was far from being
an uncommon custom in China; slave-girls who have
been brought up with natural feet are habitually
dressed as boys, and it is common now for fathers
of small daughters with unbound feet to avoid the
unpleasant taunts of the ignorant by allowing their
daughters while they are children to wear boys'
clothes.
</p>

<p>
Still on the whole the desire for imitation of the
West has been very beneficial to the women of China,
especially in this matter of foot-binding.  This
disgusting custom is going out of fashion among the
enlightened and educated classes; two or three
Chinese gentlemen assured us that this was so;
and in a place like Shanghai, where the Western
movement is very strong, the number of women with
unbound feet is quite remarkable; the greater number
of them naturally have had their feet bound, and as
feet bound from infancy never become quite normal,
they still have something of the tottering walk which
used to be the admiration of every Chinaman; in fact,
this tottering walk is preserved as a piece of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
affectation.  A lady told us that even her Christian girls'
school was not above such a feminine weakness.  As
they walked to Church they would step out with
the swinging stride that regular gymnastic
exercises and a most comfortable dress have encouraged;
suddenly the lady would see the whole of her school
struck with a sort of paralysis which made them
exchange their easy gait for the "tottering-lily" walk
of the Chinese small-footed women.  The cause is
that the boys' school has just come into sight.  I
fear it must be admitted that foot-binding
continues to be practised in the interior amongst the
poorer women, who cling to the custom for fear of
ridicule.
</p>

<p>
The most beneficial effect of the admiration of
the West is the earnest desire that it has given to
Chinese women for education.  So keen is this desire
that even married women will become children again
and take their position in the class.  Husbands who
have received Western education are most anxious
that their wives should share somewhat in their
interests.
</p>

<p>
Lady Florence could see over girls' schools where
a man's visit would not have been acceptable, so she
visited many of all varieties, including two at Peking
of a rather unusual description.  One of them was
carried on by a Manchu lady of high position, connected
with a great Manchu prince.  Her attitude generally
towards the forward women's movement offends her
family, as she lectures publicly on topics of the time.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
Her school is small, and, alas, not very efficient, she
having fallen into the usual fallacy amongst the
Chinese of believing that a Japanese instructress
must of necessity be efficient.  Still her desire to
give education to the children of the poor is worthy
of nothing but commendation.  She looked most
impressive, being a fine big handsome woman, attired
in the Manchu long robe with the ornate Manchu
head-dress.  The second school my wife saw was
managed by another Manchu lady, and it seemed more
orderly and more successful than the other.  These
two schools testified to a desire to improve the status
of women.  My wife visited many other schools, some
belonging to missions of various denominations, which
attracted the daughters and even the wives of
upper-class men, who mixed quite happily with girls of
lower degree, being all united in a fervent desire for
education, the ruling desire now in China among
women of all classes.
</p>

<p>
This desire for education is a great opportunity for
the missionaries, and they appeal most eloquently in the
message from which we have already quoted for help
from their sisters in England.  "We need more schools
for girls and more consecrated and highly trained
women competent to conduct such schools and
gradually to give higher and higher instruction in them.
We need more training schools, also, for Chinese
women, to fit them to work among their sisters,
and we need educated Christian ladies from our
homelands for Zenana work in the houses of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
well-to-do.  Such work would have been impossible
a few years ago; now the visits of such workers
would in many cases be cordially welcomed by
Chinese ladies, and frequently they would be
returned, for the seclusion of women in China is
not at all as strict as it is in India.  This, so far,
has been a comparatively unworked sphere of
usefulness in China, but it is one full of promise and of
gracious opportunity in the present."
</p>

<p>
The difficulty of education is in one way increased
and in another way decreased by the ignorance which
many women have of reading the Chinese characters.
A new system has been invented by which Chinese
can be written in our letters as pronounced.  This is
called by the rather uncouth name of "Romanised."  At
the Shanghai Conference we were told wonderful
stories of the incredibly short space of time in which
women learnt to read by this system.  A woman
of sixty-seven learnt in two months; while one
lady asserted that she had taught a boy to read
between Friday and Wednesday, I may add inclusive.
This extraordinary achievement is not quite so
impossible as it would be with our more complicated
languages.  The Chinese have extremely few sounds,
and their language is monosyllabic in formation.
However, we do not ask our readers to accept this
as the normal rate of education; still the thing is
worth mentioning, because it is possibly the beginning
of a great movement which may alter the whole of
education in the Far East.  The extreme ease with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
which Chinese can be written in our letters may
induce some daring spirit to advocate it as a system
fitted for the education of the poor, though this is at
present quite improbable.
</p>

<p>
A far darker side to the introduction of Western
ways is the gradual naturalisation of the social evils
of the West.  Lady Florence had the privilege of
seeing some of the rescue work undertaken by devoted
missionary ladies in Shanghai.  Being an open port,
this town, in common, I believe, with the other
semi-Westernised ports in China, bears a very bad
character as regards purity of morals.  The advent of the
foreigner has done nothing but harm in this respect.
Wonderful and horrible though it may seem, the
vice-mart exists in the ports mainly in connection
with the foreigners, who appear to have shown the
way to the Chinese.  There is a street in Shanghai,
the Foochow Road, where terrible scandals occur
almost openly; signs whose intention is veiled to
the outsider by his ignorance of Chinese characters,
boldly advertise the merits of various houses and
their inmates.  Formerly these wretched girls were
even paraded in open chairs, but this has been
stopped, though they are still carried about in closed
chairs.  The scenes in this street as night falls are
a sad witness to the ill effect of Western ideas without
Christianity.  It must never be forgotten that the
victims of this condition of things are literally
victims.  They have no choice in the matter.  They
are sold by their parents, even by their husbands,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
into their terrible position; and though some may
live a life of luxury, most of them are cruelly
treated, beaten, tortured to prevent flight, and, as
is proved by their subsequent conduct, they regard
the life with absolute loathing.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by profound pity for these poor creatures,
these excellent ladies started a Refuge for them with
a receiving-house in the very midst of this locality
of ill-fame.  To this haven the poor things often
flee even in the middle of the night, facing
the unknown, undeterred by rumours of the evil
intentions of the foreigners put about by their
owners, rather than endure longer the life of
degradation and misery to which they have been
condemned.  The missionaries receive them and pass
them on to the "Door of Hope," the appropriately
named Refuge, which restores them to hope and peace
and happiness.  There were to be seen some eighty
young women living a hard-working simple life,
contented and merry, and apparently never regretting
for one moment the fine clothes and lazy luxury
which many of them had renounced.  The ladies
teach them useful arts, instruct them in Christianity,
and fit them for wives to Chinese Christians who
will be good to them, and, understanding well that
their former life was involuntary, are glad to have
wives with a modicum of education.  The ladies will
allow non-Christians to mate with non-Christians,
if of good character; but they will not permit any
of their rescued flock to become secondary wives.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
Two things are remarkable in this work of almost
divine compassion&mdash;a relapse is practically unknown;
and it is the Chinese who are most helpful in
encouraging it&mdash;more so than foreigners; the Chinese
often themselves suggest the "Door of Hope" to
these girls, and help in police cases to save them
from their brutal owners.
</p>

<p>
The risk that China runs at this moment in the
home-life is the same as the risk that she is running
in every other department of her national existence.
If the materialist side of Western civilisation is the
one that is the most apparent, it is scarcely possible
that it will fail to do great damage to her home-life.
A thoughtful Chinaman, talking about the whole
question, argued in favour of a complete acceptance of
Western ideas.  He was afraid of a half measure.
He said that there was no question that women in
the West are restrained by a mass of conventions of
whose value they are perhaps unconscious, but which
are very apparent to those who have been brought
up in a different civilisation.  It is the existence of
these conventions that makes their liberty possible.
If the Chinese are to accept Western civilisation for
their women, and he regarded this as inevitable, they
must learn the conventions; and therefore his
solution to the problem was that Chinese girls should be
brought to England and brought up as English girls.
</p>

<p>
But many missionaries plead for the opposite
policy.  They say: "Let us preserve what is good
in the Chinese home-life, let Christianity permeate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
that life and make it beautiful, but do not destroy
it.  The Chinese home-life fits the Chinese race.  The
Westernised Chinawoman will combine the errors of
both civilisations and the virtues of neither."
</p>

<p>
Without giving an opinion on this very vexed
question, we may express a hope that a policy of
prudence and moderation will govern the action of
those who are concerned with women's education, for
the degree of alteration which may be necessary in
women's life to make them fitted to receive Western
civilisation will be a matter rather of experiment
than of theory.  At any rate let Christianity precede
any large alterations, for Christianity alone can make
the life of a Western woman intelligible and
consistent to her Eastern sister.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<h4>
CHINESE ARCHITECTURE
</h4>

<p>
Among the many ways a nation has of expressing its
thoughts and of showing its individuality, none is
more valuable to mankind in general than its art.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it can be said that every civilised nation
has contributed to the common stock of art, and
certainly China has done her share.  The porcelain
which is called after her name testifies to her
pre-eminence in ceramic art, and should make Westerns
cautious in expressing their contempt for a race which
is generally acknowledged to be the originator of
this industry.  I will not attempt to express an
opinion about the mysteries of this art, except to
regret that the name of the country should be so
attached to this product of her skill as constantly to
cause confusion.  When my friend Archdeacon Moule
published his interesting book on "New China and
Old," a lady wrote to him to say that she did not
care for new china, but as she was a collector of old
china, she would much like to read his book.
</p>

<p>
China has contributed to other forms of art as
well.  Her embroideries and her lacquer work are
well known; her ivory carving and silver work have
found a place in every collection.  Her art, as we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
might expect from a race which has been under
artificial conditions of civilisation for many years, is
distinctly artificial.  In it you can see the spirit of a
race who for many centuries have been taught to
control themselves and to avoid the natural expression
of their feelings.  If it is artificial in form, it is
pleasing in colour and superb in workmanship.  There are
few who will not agree that every effort should be
made to preserve these arts from being injured by a
false admiration of Western models.  The only possible
exception being modern embroideries, which might
be considerably improved if more harmonious colours
were blended together.
</p>

<p>
China excels in another art, though her excellence
is not admitted either by the foreign resident or even
by the native student.  In certain forms of
architecture she is unequalled.  Yet when the Westerner
comes to China he glories in bringing with him
Western architecture, indifferent as to whether it is
suited to the climatic conditions or is in itself
beautiful.  Take, for instance, the English churches of
China.  Could any form of architecture be less suited
to a country like China, where the sun is frequently
oppressively hot, than Gothic architecture?  The
large windows, the pointed arch, and the weak, open,
high-pitched roof may be suitable in a country like
ours which has little sunlight, and where a wet
drifting snow will often force an entrance into the
best-designed roof; but in a country like China,
where the sun is the chief difficulty, some construction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
should be preferred which renders a heavy and
heat-proof roof possible.  If antipathy to the Chinese
necessitated a Western type of building, Italian or
even Romanesque architecture might be selected, and a
building with a massive roof supported on solid arches
might resist the rays of the sun.  But why not accept
the Chinese architecture as eminently fitted for the
climate?
</p>

<p>
If Christianity is to be assimilated by China and
become part of their national existence, the
buildings in which it is proclaimed should be essentially
national.  The intention of the Christian should be
written clearly on the face of every landscape where
the new and beautiful Chinese building rises up for
the religion which is, as we maintain, as essentially
fitted for the Chinese as it is for the English.  We
do not worship in a Roman basilica, but in the
buildings that the northern architects have devised
as suitable, both for Christian worship and for our
climate.  The new Chinese churches need not be
replicas of the Chinese temples; the object of the
building is different, therefore the building should
differ, but there are many other forms in which it
is possible for the architect to express in Chinese
architecture the eternal truths of Christianity.
</p>

<p>
Again, why are all the schools and colleges erected
on Western patterns.  The Chinese are used to and
prefer their own architecture, and from a sanitary
point of view I hardly think it is inferior.  The
average Westerner in China has but one idea, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
that is that the Chinese must become like a Western
nation or must remain untouched by Western civilisation.
He absolutely refuses the suggestion that the
architecture of China can be altered to suit modern
conditions.
</p>

<p>
It is said that the thoughts of all nations are
written in their architecture; that you can see the
nobility of the Middle Ages in the Gothic cathedral,
or the fulness of the thought of the Renaissance
in the Palladian facade; certainly on the modern
Chinese town the story of their change of thought
is being rapidly written, perhaps with truth, but
certainly not with beauty.  The Western man
absolutely despising all things Chinese refuses to
erect any building which preserves even a detail
of the national architecture; the Westernising
Chinaman in faithful imitation erects Western buildings,
but with this difference; whereas the buildings of
the Western have some beauty&mdash;for instance, the
cathedral at Shanghai is a noble building and
the Pe-T'ang at Peking would not disgrace an
Italian town, even the bankers' palaces at Hankow
are not unworthy dwellings for merchant princes&mdash;the
Chinese imitations of these Western buildings
have but little beauty to commend them, and as
far as I could understand they are really less
serviceable than a true Chinese building.
</p>

<p>
No European resident in China will ever allow
that Chinese buildings are either beautiful or useful,
and if any one suggests that a Western house shall
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
be built in the Chinese style the suggestion is scouted
as absurd; yet the British Legation at Peking is an
old Chinese palace, and no one who has seen it ever
doubts that it is one of the most beautiful buildings
in the whole of China, and if this building has
been found fitting for His Majesty's Representative,
surely some such building might serve for others
of less high station.
</p>

<p>
As to the spiritual ideals in Chinese architecture,
who can doubt them when they look at some of the
pagodas that the reverence of Buddhism has
produced.  These pagodas tell in every line of a nation
that would reach up above mere utilitarianism to
higher thoughts.  The uselessness of the pagoda
which so often annoys the practical Englishman is
one of its chief merits.  It stands there in all its
beauty pleading with mankind for a love of beauty
for its own sake and a belief in a beautiful spirit
world.  The whole of Buddhist thought is intimately
connected with the love of beauty.  When a Chinese
gentleman was asked if the Chinese had any love
of beauty, he said: "You will notice that their
temples are always built in beautiful spots, so that
they who worship in them should satisfy their love
of beauty."
</p>

<p>
Even if the pagoda is merely regarded as a thing
to bring luck to a town, it still merits admiration,
for there must be something fine in a race that
believes a beautiful thing can bring the blessing
of the heavenly bodies on the earth.  No one can
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
study the details of any of these pagodas without
being confident that those who erected them had
as their main object the erection of a beautiful
building.
</p>

<p>
Or again, take the Temple of Heaven.  Is there
any monument in the whole world that has more
feeling of beauty about it?  The white altar lying
uncovered testifies to the fundamental faith of the
Chinese that there is a God in heaven who dwelleth
not in temples made with hands, while the detail
of the carving, though showing a certain sameness,
yet indicates their belief that God must love beauty.
To see the white Altar of Heaven together with
the blue-roofed Temple beyond on some sunny day
when the flowers are blooming and the dark green
of the pine grove is in strong contrast with the
light green of the spring herbage, is one of those
visions of beauty which make a man dream and
dream again of the noble future that may be before
a race which has its holiest places in such lovely
surroundings.
</p>

<p>
As most of the readers of this book may never
have seen a Chinese building, perhaps it should be
described.  The architecture of the Chinese differs
from that of the West in almost every detail.  A
Chinese town is a town without chimneys, and yet
the absence of those chimneys which Renaissance
architects made such a feature of domestic architecture
is never missed, for Chinese roofs are curved
and decorated with quaint figures; they are often
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
coloured, bright yellow if the building is an imperial
building, or bright blue or blue and green with yellow
lines, as taste may direct.  Common houses have not
such ornate roofs, but I am speaking of the houses
which have some claim to architectural excellence.
This great roof is carried directly on pillars, so that it
is possible to have a Chinese house without walls,
and these wall-less houses are most suitable to a
country where the summer is hot.  The massive
character of the roof prevents the heat of the sun
penetrating, and the absence of walls allows of a
free current of air; if there are walls they are
generally wooden screens filled in with paper, and the
effect in some old Chinese houses is very lovely.
</p>

<p>
For winter weather these houses seem cold to us,
but the Chinese have always believed in the open-air
policy.  They never heat their houses; they rely
either on warm clothing or on a flue-heated bed at
night; and as they are as a race very subject to
consumption, probably this policy is one which is
best suited to their constitutions.  At any rate it
seems strange that while we in England are advocating
open-air schools, open-air cures, and sleeping
with the window open, in China Western influence
should be destroying the admiration for a splendid
form of architecture, the characteristic of which was
that while it was of great beauty, it also shielded
the inmates from the intense heat of summer and
gave them ample fresh air.
</p>

<p>
When some Chinese literati were questioned
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
about this architecture they freely confessed that
they preferred their native buildings, but they
seemed to think that a Western school could not
be efficient unless it was held in a Western building.
Missionaries and others being questioned on this
point maintained that Western houses were in the
end the cheapest, but the Chinese would not allow
this.  They said that a Chinese house would cost far
more than a Western house if it were beautifully
adorned with carving, but if it was built simply it
would work out at less cost.
</p>

<p>
Chinese architecture is obviously a construction
which lends itself to the use of iron.  A Chinese
building with iron substituted for wood would look
as well, for they always paint their wood; this
ought to be a very cheap form of construction in a
land which is going to produce iron at a very low
rate.  The truth is that it is neither a question of
cost nor of efficiency which makes the Chinese
architecture despised; it is part of the great movement
which expresses itself in stone and brick&mdash;a movement
which is tending to bring the Eastern countries
into misery&mdash;a movement which is planting in the
East all that is commonplace, all that is hideous in
the West, and that is destroying all that is beautiful
in the East both in thought and colour and form.
It is the counterpart of the movement which is
destroying the faith of the Eastern nations and is
only substituting the materialism which has degraded
the West.

RELIGIONS OF CHINA AND THE MISSIONARY

CHAPTER XII

<h4>
RELIGIONS IN CHINA
</h4>

<p>
The real power of a race lies in its religion; other
motives inevitably tend to egotism, disorganisation,
and national death, and China is no exception to
the rule; the strength and the weakness of China
lies in her religion and in its absence.  There are
few nations who set less store by the outward
observance of religion and yet there are few nations with a
greater belief in the supernatural.  On the one hand,
the temples are deserted or turned into schools, and
the Chinese are believed to have no other motives
than self-interest.  On the other hand, the whole of
Chinese life turns round the relation of man to the
spirit of his ancestors and to the spiritual world,
and the Chinaman obviously believes that a man's
soul is immortal and that its welfare has the very
closest connection with the welfare of his descendant.
</p>

<p>
The commercial man will tell you that the
Chinese are materialists&mdash;people who have no faith;
and yet with glorious inconsistency he will explain
that the difficulty of using Chinese labour abroad
is that even the commonest coolie demands that
his body shall be repatriated and shall lie in some
place which will not hinder his son doing filial
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
worship to his spirit.  The whole question of what
the race believes is rendered more difficult of
comprehension to a Westerner by the confused nature
of that belief, and is complicated by the characteristic
of the Chinese of mixing all religions together
regardless of their natural incongruity.  It is hoped
that the reader will bear this in mind during the
following explanation.
</p>

<p>
The religions of China are usually classed as
three.  Not three well-marked religions in our sense
of the word, but three elements which tend to merge
into a common religion.  There are separate religions.
A large number of Chinese, for instance, are
Mohammedan, and they neither marry nor are given in
marriage to the other Chinese; there is a very
small Jewish community; and there is also a native
Greek Christian village still tolerated by the Chinese,
which was transplanted from Siberia as the result of
a Chinese conquest in the days of Peter the Great;
there are a quarter of a million Christians converted
by non-Roman missions, besides a million belonging to
the Roman Catholic Communion.  But Christianity,
Judaism, and Mohammedanism put all together, form
but a small part of the Chinese community, and
the greater part of China believes, according to all
orthodox expositors, in three religions&mdash;Buddhism,
Taoism, and what is termed Confucianism.
</p>

<p>
This conglomerate of three religions consists in
its turn of composite faiths.  Buddhism in China is
not like the Buddhism of Ceylon with its agnostic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
teaching.  Buddhism is divided into two great
divisions&mdash;the "greater vehicle" and the "lesser
vehicle."  The "lesser vehicle" is known to the
world as pure Buddhism; the "greater vehicle"
contains many sects, all of which claim that the
revelation extended to Gautama was only a partial
revelation, and that the truth has been more fully
revealed to those who succeeded him.  This is called
Lamaism, and in China has incorporated much of the
idolatry which it supplanted and perhaps some of the
Nestorian Christianity which succeeded it; in fact,
the Buddhist temple in China is nothing more than
an idol temple.  Buddha of Gautama is always the
principal idol; he is represented calm and without
thought or trouble; he sits, the embodiment of
peace and rest; but though he may be the first in
the Buddhist temple, he is far from being alone;
close behind him in popular estimation come two
other deities, Amita and Kwannin.  Amita, Amitobha
or O-mi-to, is held by some to be the father of
Kwannin, and is at once a guardian of the Western
Paradise and the personification of purity; to this
wholly mythical personage is attributed such virtue
that the mere repetition of his name will secure
salvation.  In Japan a sect holds that every
Buddhist law can be broken with immunity as long
as there is faith in Amita.  In China such
statements are made as this: to follow the strict law
of Buddhism is to climb to heaven as a fly crawls
up the wall, but to attain Salvation by repeating
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
the name O-mi-to is like sailing heavenwards in a
boat with wind and tide behind, at the pace of a
hundred li an hour.  There is a general agreement
that adherence to the strict Buddhist law of chastity,
honesty, truth, temperance, abstinence from anger
and serenity of mind, is an ideal which is impossible
at any rate for the laity.  But the exact method of
escaping this burden differs in various sects.  The
most popular is by a "saving faith" in Amita.
</p>

<p>
If the origin of this deity can be attributed to
the personification of a spirit of purity, the origin
of the next, Kwannin, is probably from some source
outside Buddhism.  She is the goddess of mercy, but
whatever her origin, she at present represents the
remnants of either the Nestorian or the mediæval
Roman teaching.  In Peking they have a curious
image of her which any one might mistake for a
Madonna, the truth being that there was at one
time an intimate contact between Christianity and
Buddhism, when many of the externals of the
Christian religion and some of its doctrines were
transplanted.  The Buddhist temple with its altar
in the centre looks strangely like a Christian church,
and the Buddhist monks and nuns, with their
rosaries and their regular hours for chanting and
service, recall the Roman Catholic services; the
picture of the Buddhist hell which stands in the
great Mongol temple at Peking reminds one of a
scene from Dante's Inferno, and among the many
things the Buddhists borrow from Christian sources
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
are these two ideas, embodied in two idols, the
goddess of mercy who intercedes for mankind, and
the god of faith in whom the worshipper should
put all trust and confidence.  Besides these gods
there are the god of war and the god of
good-fellowship, probably taken from old heathen sources.
Again, there are hundreds of Buddhas, or as we
should call them, "saints," whose position is
somewhere between human and divine, much the same
position that the saints occupy in the mind of a
Neapolitan peasant.
</p>

<p>
After Buddhism comes Taoism.  Taoism is again
a conglomerate faith.  Technically it is the faith of
Laotze, who was an opponent and a contemporary of
Confucius.  He taught a dualism which reminds the
Westerner of the doctrine of the Manichees.  Again,
Western and Eastern thought have been confused;
Manichees are known to have existed in China, and
whether Manichæism originally came from the East
or whether subsequently Chinese thought has been
affected by Manichæism is hard to decide.  At any
rate, Laotze did not claim that his teaching was
original; he was merely the prophet of an established
school of thought.  The greater part of China follows
his rival and despises Laotze's teaching, yet the
dualism that he taught is part of the essential faith
of China, and a part which is most opposed to all
that is good.  He taught that good and evil were
essentially divided, were halves, as it were, of one
whole.  He called them the "Yang" and the "Yin"&mdash;terms
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
which are in no way confined to the few
disciples who now follow him.  This division between
good and evil makes up the mystery of the
world&mdash;light and darkness, heaven and earth, male and
female, each couple makes up one whole divided
between good and evil; and so the world beyond is
peopled with good and evil spirits, the "Yang" and
the "Yin."  Obviously such a faith has all the evil
which we recognise in Manichæism, and its practical
disadvantages are very great.  For instance, the
inferior position of women is defended as inevitable;
they are "Yin."  No mine must be sunk or cutting
made for fear of angering the earth spirits, for as man
is as essentially a part of the world as the earth,
those earth spirits will avenge themselves upon him.
Even such great men and such good Confucianists
as His Excellency the late Chang-Chih-Tung are not
insensitive to such a superstition.  The town over
which he ruled was divided by a steep gravel hill.  A
Western engineer recommended that this hill should
be cut through to facilitate access from one part of
the town to the other, and the Viceroy, ever ready to
accept new and Western ideas of practical advantage,
immediately ordered the suggestion to be carried out.
Shortly afterwards a large wen developed on his neck,
and, arguing that an evil spirit of the earth, who had
originally made the gravel hill, was so angered at the
destruction of it that he determined to re-make it on
the neck of the offender, the Governor had the cutting
filled up, and there it stands to this very day, a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
witness of the evil influence that an evil religion can
have on the greatest men of a nation.  Taoism has
now but few adherents, and yet there are many
Taoist priests, since these priests are regarded as
particularly efficient in dealing with the evil spirits
in whom Taoism believes so fully.
</p>

<p>
The third religion is generally called Confucianism,
and this may easily lead to a great misunderstanding,
for under the term Confucianism two very different
things are included.  First, a belief in the philosophy
of Confucius.  This for the most part is outside what
we are accustomed to call religion, and we shall have
occasion to deal with it later on.  Secondly, and more
commonly, the spiritual beliefs of those who call
themselves Confucians, and who, owing to his silence on
religion, have to find other authorities for their faith.
Sometimes they claim that their faith was the same
as the faith of Confucius, that the background of his
philosophy was the religion that they believe, but
more commonly they accept it without any question.
This religion is commonly mixed up both with
Buddhism and with Taoism, but its essential doctrine
is very distinct and has great weight in China,
namely, that the spirits of men who are dead live
and have influence over the lives of their descendants.
I was told by a Chinese Christian that a religious
Chinaman of the lower class never goes out without
burning a stick of incense to the tablet of his father,
and no one can go through Chinese towns without
being impressed by the number of people who in that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
poor country are kept hard at work manufacturing
mock money to be burnt for the use of parents and
ancestors.
</p>

<p>
The missionaries find that this doctrine is the
hardest doctrine for Christianity to assail; and there
are not a few who, despairing of success, suggest that
the position must be turned, and ancestor worship
must be Christianised and accepted as an essential
part of a man's belief.  The logical Western mind
immediately wants to know what is behind the
ancestor; if an ancestor is to have power he can
only have it, says the logical Westerner, by being
in contact with some higher power.  One of the
greatest missionaries that China possesses answers
this difficulty by saying that the Chinese mind is
not the Western mind; that he does not concern
himself very much with remote speculation; he has
not that itching longing to use the word "why,"
which is at once the glory and the difficulty of the
Western mind, and therefore he looks at the spiritual
world much as he looks at the earthly world; the
man immediately over him in the town is the magistrate,
and, to use the Chinese phrase, "is the father
and mother of his people," and so over him in spiritual
things is his father and grandfather.  Behind the
magistrate there is in his distant thought the
prefect&mdash;the head of the prefecture or Fu town&mdash;a being
who only comes into his village life when there is
trouble and difficulty; he comes to punish, rarely to
reward, and so behind his father and grandfather in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
the spiritual world are the great clan leaders whom
he worships at regular intervals with the rest of his
clan.  In civil government there are in a distant
background a Viceroy with awful powers and awful
majesty, and an Emperor whose very name is so
divine that he scarcely likes to use it; and behind
the clan leaders are many beings borrowed from
Buddhism, relics of old idolatry, muddled up
with Taoism; and in the dim and distant
background is the Supreme Being&mdash;the Supreme Being
Who rewards the just and punishes the unjust, Who
can in no way be deceived, Who refuses the rain to
the sinner and makes the land desolate, Who has
power to dethrone the earthly Emperor and to place
China under a foreign domination.  This great and
awful power is, however, so far distant that the
average Chinaman thinks but little about Him.
</p>

<p>
The Temple of Heaven at Peking is the beautiful
shrine of this Supreme Being.  Here once a year,
after spending a night fasting, the Emperor, as the
father of his nation, worships the great God who
made heaven and earth.  The chief feature of this
worship is that it is performed in the open air on
a beautiful marble dais.  No place in China is quite
so lovely; it is the fitting shrine of the beautiful
faith of China's most glorious days, a faith which
though dormant is not dead.  The traveller who
stands there should remember that the worship
which is here performed is as old as the date of
the patriarchs and not un-akin to their religious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
ideals; and if there are some things which are not
sympathetic to the Christian idea, they are
subordinate.  In the main it is the worship of the One
True Being.
</p>

<p>
This faith has no right to be called Confucian.
There is great doubt about the faith of Confucius.
He is silent about religion, or he refers to it only
indirectly; it is no part of his teaching; but his
indirect references to it apparently express a belief in a
Supreme Being whom he calls "Heaven," a Supreme
Being who has an influence on human affairs.  He also
recognises ancestor worship, but with such a dubious
phrase that many Chinese and English scholars have
doubted his meaning.  Neither is this the faith of all
the leading Confucianists in China, many of whom
are professedly agnostics in matters of religion, and
follow the teaching of Chu; but it is the faith,
the ill-understood faith, of the great multitude of
thinking and non-thinking Chinamen, and it is
looked upon as the State religion of China.  Its
power over China is universal and yet insecure.
</p>

<p>
Many ages ago it was partially defeated by the
more logical and more sympathetic faith of Buddhism.
The fight was bitter, the persecutions were cruel, but
Buddhism conquered.  Now Buddhism fails.  With
its failure a vast mass of superstition, kept alive by
the sacrifice to the ancestor, once more rises up and
stands right in the path of progress&mdash;right in the
way of civilisation.  It was superstition that moved
the Boxer, and this it was that lost credit when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
Boxerdom failed.  Story after story is told of the
influence of this incoherent but vital mass of religion.
The junk will dart across the bows of your steamer;
there will be much whistling, reversing of engines,
peremptory commands in English, abuse in Chinese;
and when you inquire why the lowdah of the junk
risked his cargo, perhaps his life, and put the steamer
and its passengers in a state of excitement, if not in
jeopardy, the answer is that every junk lowdah is
afraid of the evil spirit that is following him, and
if he crosses the steamer's bow he expects that the
evil spirit, seeing a more worthy quarry, will neglect
him and follow the steamer.  The head of the Shanghai
Telephone Company tells how he is not uncommonly
met by some sleek well-to-do Chinaman who is most
distressed because the shadow of a telephone pole
falls over his door, so that as he goes out he passes
beneath it, and that will bring bad luck.  The houses
in China stand unconformably with the road, because
a certain aspect is lucky; a cracker is exploded to
frighten the evil spirits away, and so on through tales
innumerable.
</p>

<p>
The world around is full of evil spirits to the
Chinaman.  Every village has the witch doctor who
is learned in the ways of these evil spirits.  Diabolical
possession is as present with them as ever it was in
Bible times.  Your hard-headed commercial man smiles
when he relates these stories, incredulous that there
can be any foundation for them; but those who have
dwelt among the Chinese take much the same line
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
about these stories as we do about spiritualism.  Much
is folly, more is fraud; but behind both the folly and
the fraud there is a mysterious reality.  The faith
of the masses of China in the spiritual world has
never been encouraged by its philosophers.  It owes
its vitality to the fact that, as with us, so with them,
manifestations of powers beyond this world are real
if ill-comprehended, and connected too often with
man's evil side.  The Psychical Research Society
will do well to inquire closely into many of these
phenomena.  Nothing convinced me of the reality
of this belief more than the line that was taken by
one of our English missionaries.  He was speaking
of diabolical possession, and he related the same story
which one has heard so often that a man suddenly
spoke as another personality; and then he added,
"I realised that it was not he who was speaking
to me, but the evil spirit within him;" and he went
on, "I was afraid to speak to him, because if you
speak to those who are possessed with an evil spirit,
the evil spirit will take possession of you."  It was
strange to hear such a testimony to the reality of
diabolical possession from an Englishman, but you
will hear it from every Chinaman.  Those who have
read "Pastor Hsi" will remember how firm was his
belief in such possession.
</p>

<p>
Against all this mass of the evil world the Chinaman
has but one defence: his father and his ancestor
belong to that world and they will defend him; and
so the ancestor cult is intimately connected with this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
belief in evil spirits.  If the father does not bestir
himself the son may come to harm&mdash;in fact, the main
part of a Chinaman's religious idea centres round
ancestor worship; and there is no such awful moment
in a Christian convert's life as when he is required to
destroy the tablet of his ancestors.  A Confucianist
cannot understand the missionary position; to his
mind contempt for the ancestor only means a deep
and spiritual scepticism, an absence of all faith in
the supernatural, a negation of all sense of duty.  A
missionary recounted a story illustrative of this
difficulty.  He was travelling up-country in China, and his
road lay along the same way down which a well-to-do
merchant was travelling, and as they journeyed on side
by side and met every night at the inns at which
they put up, he noticed that the Chinaman eyed him
askance; but as the missionary spoke Chinese well,
and as travellers have many little wants which
another traveller can supply, it was not unnatural
that in spite of the mistrust manifested by the
Chinaman they should fall gradually into more intimate
converse.  One night as they were sitting at an inn
the Chinaman said to the missionary, "Do you know
I thought you were a Christian, but I see you are a
good fellow."  The missionary assured him that he
was a Christian, and did not deny that he was a good
fellow.  He felt, however, that there was some obstacle
in the Chinaman's mind that kept them still apart,
and as they journeyed on from day to day and had
grown more intimate, the Chinaman said, "You know
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
people do tell such lies that one cannot believe a word
they say."  The missionary assented to this general
proposition as true of all the world, but asked for a
more immediate application.  The Chinaman continued:
"Well, I hope you will not be offended if I tell you
the lies they tell about you&mdash;lies that I am afraid I
believed till I met you and could see what a good
fellow you are.  They say&mdash;" but he broke off.
"Pardon me, it is such a horrible accusation that I
do not like to repeat it, even though I know that it is
untrue."  The missionary pressed him to tell what
this accusation was, and the Chinaman continued
apologetically, "I know that it is such a lie that I
am ashamed that my people should tell such lies, but
they do say that you Christians actually teach men
to break up the tablet on which their father's name is
written;" and the missionary realised all at once the
depth of the conviction of the Chinaman and the
wide gulf that separated him from Christianity.
And so many and many a person who knows China
best confidently asserts that Christianity will never
become the religion of China till it permits and
recognises this ancestral worship.
</p>

<p>
But now a new factor has entered into this
problem.  Western materialism is spreading its malign
influence over China; the educated classes of Japan
boldly profess that they have long since ceased to
believe in any religion, and they are calling upon
China with great effect to follow their example, and
so the position changes altogether.  Ancestor worship,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
with all its accompanying superstition, tends to
disappear where Western knowledge is taught.  The
Boxers were not untrue prophets when they told
their people that they or Western civilisation, as they
knew it, must leave China, and that they could not
co-exist.  The position is surely one that must excite
the very deepest interest.  It is scarcely conceivable
that a race so deeply convinced of the realities of the
spiritual world will, as a whole, accept the belief that
there are no spirits.  It is equally inconceivable that
with modern Western education the people shall
believe in the spirit that follows the junk, or in the
spirit that is angered by a mining operation.  The
religious sentiment of China will, as it were, be
turned out of doors by Western knowledge.  There
will be a terrible moment when, with all the
insolence of youth, the young man refuses to believe
in God or in a devil, and rushes into every wild
anarchical and socialistic scheme to satisfy his craving
for action.
</p>

<p>
It is a terrible moment, and one which one sees
rapidly developing in Japan and among the Westernised
Chinese; but beyond that terrible period there
dawns a brighter day when China will reassert its
natural sentiment and will accept Christianity as
the only reasonable religion that is consonant
with modern science and a belief in the spiritual
world.  The question of policy that needs solving
is whether it is wise in the face of this great
Western unbelieving movement to treat respect for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
ancestors too drastically.  Western education must
remove its objectionable features and Christianity
might accept the modified form of this belief which
is not wholly inconsistent with the doctrine of the
resurrection of the dead.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<h4>
CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHY AND WESTERN CULTURE
</h4>

<p>
It is not realised in the West how much the modern
movement in Japan owes its power and vitality to
a native movement which welcomed change.  In
Japan Buddhism had failed, the one school of
Confucianism which believed in change was dominant,
and therefore it was a comparatively easy matter
to introduce the extensive changes of Western
civilisation.  There was no religion with roots deeply
entwined in the hearts of the people to oppose such
a change.  Shintoism had not yet been rediscovered
and established, and it consisted merely of a mass
of superstition, without any literature or organisation.
Thus it was the combination of these facts, with the
threatening attitude of Western powers, which made
all the prophecies of men who knew the East untrue.
No one understood the vital power of the movement
in Japan.  If, thirty years ago, some one had written
a book to prove that Japan would one day defeat
Russia, people would have laughed at the
suggestion, and the authority of people who had lived in
the East all their lives would have been quoted to
prove that an Eastern race could never fully accept
Western civilisation.  The prophets were misled by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
the precedent of India and Turkey.  The Western
civilisation is met there by religions whose tenets
are opposed to Western thought, and as long as those
religions hold, Western views will make but small
progress; but in Japan there was no such religion,
and in China to-day there is no such religion.  The
Buddhism of China, like the Buddhism of Japan, may
satisfy the cravings for spiritual religion of the
uneducated and the ignorant; but the thinkers of both
races&mdash;the statesmen, the writers, the leaders&mdash;are
uninfluenced by Buddhism.  Taoism has contributed
to the thought and superstition of China, but is in no
way now an important factor in her development;
the philosophy of Confucius is the one vital force in
the land.
</p>

<p>
Its doctrines are in no way opposed to our
civilisation; it teaches mainly that a man must be
sincere to his own higher nature; it has a profound
belief in the greatness of human nature, and a very
inadequate explanation, therefore, of the failures of
that nature.  That man must be sincere, so that the
full beauty of his nature may appear, is one of its
main tenets, and that this beautiful thing must be
decorated with knowledge is a natural corollary.  It
undertakes the reform of the world, by convincing
the ruler of his duty, and through him compelling the
ruled to tread the right path, contrasting here very
strongly with the religion of our Bible, though
perhaps not with political Christianity.  All through
its teaching there is an underlying suggestion that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
subjects will obey their rulers not only outwardly
but also inwardly in their opinions and convictions.
</p>

<p>
Confucianism does not believe in government by
the people, of the people, for the people; but it
believes very strongly in government for the people
by the rulers.  Many of its maxims might be cut
out as texts, and hung up in the House of Commons
with great appropriateness.  It constantly pictures
a well-ordered peaceful state, in which the dignity
of government is well maintained, and where the
working-man shall profit by his work through justice
and peace, and the trader grow rich in confident
security.  In all this teaching it is not opposed to
Western civilisation.  Confucius advocates the reform
of society by the action of the State.  Thus the
sanitary laws, the education laws, the temperance
laws of the West are thoroughly consistent with the
teaching of Confucius.  Where that teaching differs
from the West is that it disbelieves in democracy.
Yet Confucianism cares nothing for a man's birth:
all men are born equal to the Confucianist as to
the Christian; and so Confucianism has, for many
centuries, welcomed people of the lowest birth as
Governors, if they could pass the requisite examinations,
and, having given every opportunity to men of
all classes to become officials, it entrusts them and
not the people with the government of the country.
</p>

<p>
In another way Confucianism is opposed to Western
civilisation.  Confucianism believes intensely
in the dignity of government; their classics are full
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
of examples of people who, at the risk of their lives,
defied kings and maintained the dignity of their
positions; and this doctrine of dignity is consequently
very deeply ingrained in Chinese thought; it is in
reality the base of that curious doctrine of "face"
by which a man will do anything rather than confess
that he is wrong.  A great missionary recounts how
his wonderful work at Tientsin was once threatened
with destruction because a boy from the south of
China knocked a boy from the north off his bicycle,
with the result that the college was soon divided
into two factions on the question as to who should
pay for the injured bicycle.  The matter was only with
difficulty arranged by the President paying for the
bicycle and charging it to the guilty boy; but the
boy did not mind paying&mdash;he minded confessing that
he was wrong.  There was another case in this same
college where a boy had been induced to confess
privately his sorrow that he had wilfully insulted
a master.  He was prepared to suffer expulsion
rather than confess his fault openly.  He was
miserable at the prospect of leaving the college, and
when a great appeal was made to his better feelings
to say that he was sorry, he shook his head sadly.
At last he was asked, "Have you never allowed you
were wrong in your whole life?"  "No," he said,
with a look of pride, "<i>never</i>."  Odious and detestable
as this doctrine is in private life, I think I have the
authority of St. Augustine for saying that it is a
maxim of good government that however wrong an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
order may be, a superior should not confess his error,
so necessary is this doctrine of dignity to government.
Thus the Chinese expression "face" has been
commonly accepted as a good English expression when
speaking about governments.
</p>

<p>
No doubt it is this sense of dignity which gives
such authority to the Chinese official.  In many ways
it may be an element of weakness.  I was surprised
to learn that the officials in the Yamen had never
been in the shops of the city; it is beneath their
dignity.  Goods are brought to them and they buy
in their own houses.  For instance we were told how
in Changsha two patriotic bas-reliefs were put up in
a shop, one of them representing the Westerns
bringing tribute to the Emperor of China, and the other
depicting a Western woman, chained and dishevelled,
being led in as a slave.  Of course our very excellent
and most efficient representative, Consul Hewlett,
made instant representation to the Governor and
the objectionable figures were removed; but the
Chinese officials claimed that they were completely
ignorant of what was happening in the shops of the
town, because they never went there.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that this high estimation of dignity
makes much of Western government antipathetic to a
Chinaman; he cannot sympathise with a civilisation
which admires government by noisy agitation, vulgar
posters, indecent journalism.  Such an agitation as
that in favour of women's suffrage is inconceivable
and disgusting beyond words to the mind of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
a Chinese thinker; that women, whose dignity is
such that they should never be tried in a public
court; that educated ladies, whose names, in China,
must scarcely be mentioned owing to their exalted
position, should wrestle in a public crowd and be
arrested, is one of those mysteries in Western
government that the dignified Eastern mind can never hope
to understand.
</p>

<p>
Confucianism, considered by itself, is not
unfavourable to Western civilisation, and its great
influence in China will no doubt largely accelerate
the Westernisation of that vast empire.  For instance,
the policy of education is one which has been followed
by China for many a long year; all that the Chinese
are doing is to alter the object of that education.
It used to aim at giving men a complete knowledge
of the Chinese classics; now it aims at giving them
in addition a knowledge of the West and of natural
sciences; and so such an eminent Confucian scholar
and such an ardent Conservative as the late
Chang-Chih-Tung was the foremost advocate for a Western
education.
</p>

<p>
Again the development of the Press on Western
lines takes place rapidly in China, where newspapers
have long been known, and which boasts of being
a country possessing the oldest newspaper in the
world, the <i>Peking Gazette</i>.  Translations of Western
literature issued by the Christian Literature Society
are read with avidity by a race that esteems
literature highly, no matter with what subject it deals,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
and who has no worse an epithet for one of its
emperors than "book-burner."
</p>

<p>
Though Confucianism is not antipathetic to
Western civilisation as a whole, and by its
philosophy and literature encourages education in
Western ideas, yet those ideas will, I fear, be fatal to
that mighty system of ethics that has kept China
together, and has enabled her to conquer her
conquerors so many times.  The countries that have
never known Confucius are succeeding far better
than the countries that have been taught by him.
The fact that he always claimed that any race who
followed his teaching would be prosperous, coupled
with the fact that China, with her splendid resources
and immense population, is far poorer and weaker
than nations who know nothing of his teaching, is
sufficient to bring its own condemnation to this
philosophy.  There is a marked difference in the
teaching of Christianity and Confucianism in this
respect.  Christianity, by the example of its founder,
teaches that the world must be reformed through
the individual; and that the destruction of a State,
whether it be Jerusalem or Rome, is only a painful
incident in the upward advance of mankind.  If
every Western State were destroyed, the true
Christian would only pause longer over his reading
of the prophet Jeremiah; but when China, the home
of Confucianism, realises her powerlessness in the face
of the West, in sorrow and regret she will close the
books of Confucius, as the books that guided the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
State to destruction, even though that teaching was
pleasant and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
A great Chinaman realised that this was the
position of Japan, and told me that he did not believe
that in Japan any one really believed in Buddhism
or in Confucianism or in the new-found Shintoism;
and that, as they had not yet accepted Christianity,
they were in a state, odious to the Western and
Eastern alike, of being without moral guidance in
this world.  The position of Japan to-day will, in all
probability, be, both in regard to the constructive
and destructive effects of Western civilisation, the
condition of China to-morrow, unless indeed Christianity
can fill the vacant place in Chinese thought.
Never before has such an opportunity been presented
to the Christian world as this vast mass of population
included under the name of China, left homeless by
the action of world thought.
</p>

<p>
Those millions of people, for instance, who yearn
for a spiritual religion, and who have found in times
past some comfort in the confused and corrupt faith
of Chinese Buddhism, are now ready with open ears
to listen to any one who is prepared to teach them
a higher and more spiritual religion.  The Confucian
scholar who realises the debt that China owes to
the teaching of the sage, and yet who feels that
Western civilisation is sapping his authority and
leaving China without a moral guide, welcomes
readily the teaching of the moral philosopher who
is prepared to show that Confucianism is essentially
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
right and has evidence of Divine truth within it, but
that it only errs in not realising that the complete
salvation of man can only be accomplished by those
who appeal to his spiritual nature as well as to his
moral sentiments.
</p>

<p>
If Christianity conquers China, one of her first
actions will be to reinstate Confucius in the position
from which Western materialism has dethroned him;
but the task would be infinitely easier if Christians
could take effective action at once.  Every day that
passes makes the position more difficult.  Every
Confucian scholar who shuts up his books and opens the
books of the materialistic philosopher of the West,
will prove an additional obstacle in the way of the
Christianisation of China.  The great danger is that
the West, ignorant of what is happening in the
East, will let this opportunity pass and allow
Western materialism to establish itself as a force in China,
as it has established itself as a force in Japan.  The
world is full of examples of lost opportunities; let us
hope that China will not have to be added to that
sad category.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<h4>
INTERVIEW AT NANKING
</h4>

<p>
The best view of the religion of China is to be
obtained from the enlightened Chinese themselves,
and their views will probably be of interest to our
readers.  It should be explained that one of the
objects of our second visit to China was to inquire
whether the Chinese officials would welcome the
foundation of Universities in which Western
knowledge could be taught, and whose atmosphere should
be Christian.  When the matter was first discussed
in England it crept into the newspapers, and I
immediately received an invitation from the Director of
Chinese Students in London to discuss the subject
with him.  I had two interviews with him.  What
surprised me was that against all the opinion of the
average Englishman who is conversant with China
he did not regard the Christian character of the
University as a deterrent, but he asked one question
on which he apparently laid the very greatest stress.
He inquired, "If a University is started in China on
such lines as you propose, will you guarantee that the
teachers are efficient?"  I immediately assured him
that the learned committees who were considering
the question at both Universities would, whatever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
else they did, never allow any one to go out as
teacher unless he was most fully qualified.  He then
assured me that he had no doubt the scheme would
meet with very great sympathy in China, and that
he would give me letters of introduction to various
people who would give the very fullest information
on the subject.  Among these was one to that most
eminent man, Tuan-Fang, Viceroy of Nanking.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at Nanking I presented my letter
of introduction through the Consul, and the Viceroy
most cordially invited me to tiffin at the Yamen.
With further courtesy he sent his carriage to fetch
me.  We had a most sumptuous repast, at which
about twenty officials were present, and in
consideration of my being a foreigner some European
food was provided.  They appeared much pleased
when I assured them that I appreciated Chinese
quite as much as European food.  We had a most
pleasant luncheon, at which we discussed all manner
of topics.  I was asked to explain exactly the position
of Oxford and Cambridge, and when I mentioned
that Oxford was over a thousand years old, I had
evidently established the reputation of my University
far above that of all competitors.  The Viceroy
then admired the school system of England.  He said
the schools were "like a forest," and he assured me
that he took the very greatest interest in education,
and promised after luncheon to show me some of his
schools.  I expressed admiration of Chinese learning,
and he told me it was divided into four
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
heads&mdash;morals, elegancy of style, philosophy, and manners.
The respect that His Excellency had for Confucius
did not prevent him from admiring other philosophers,
especially Mih-Tieh, the philosopher who taught the
doctrine of universal love.  This was the more
remarkable, because at Hankow the very same point
had been discussed with some Chinese clergy over
Sunday supper, and they had referred to this
philosopher's works with considerable admiration, and
had declared that his doctrine was much more
consonant with Christianity than that of any other
Chinese philosopher.
</p>

<p>
His Excellency then discussed the danger of a
modern education.  He quite realised the obvious
evils that resulted from rashly encouraging Western
education without an ethical basis.  He said they
had observed that those who returned from the West
were less dutiful to parents than those who had
remained in China.  Then we had a long talk as
to whether it was possible to assimilate the two
and to give a man a perfect foreign and a perfect
Chinese education.  The difficulty felt was that men
with a perfect foreign education were too often unable
to write Chinese with sufficient elegance to satisfy
the fastidious taste of the cultivated Chinese scholar.
All this conversation was carried on at the dinner-table,
chiefly through interpreters, with a crowd of
Chinese servants, excluded from the room, but
looking through a window to watch when our needs
required their presence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
</p>

<p>
We discussed after tiffin the scheme for a
University and the relations between Confucianism and
Christianity.  His Excellency was much pleased that
I should take such interest in things Chinese, and
immediately said that as I had come all the way to
China to inquire into these things, I ought to receive
every information.  Turning to his secretaries, he
told them that on the next day they were to provide
scholars learned in Confucianism, Buddhism, and
Taoism to give me all the information that I
required, and arranged that the Consul and I should
return next day.  He then suggested that we should
go and inspect the school that was next his palace,
and in which his own daughter was being educated.
</p>

<p>
The school was for children of the highest class,
and contained only about thirty boys and thirty
girls.  He conducted a sort of informal examination
which I should have thought must have been
extremely trying for the children.  His Excellency and
myself came first, then two interpreters, and then
about twenty officials.  When the scholars were
examined in Western knowledge, we were asked to
put a question or to look at a copy-book; when
they were examined in Confucian knowledge, His
Excellency put the question, and the interpreters
translated to me both the question and the answer.
The intelligence of the children was of a very high
order, and they were very attractive.  The uniform
of the boys resembled that of a French schoolboy,
though the cut of the trousers showed that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
costume had been made by a Chinese tailor, probably
after a Japanese model.  The girls were dressed in
grey coats and trousers and had natural feet; this
was perhaps not quite so remarkable as it at first
appeared when one remembers that the Viceroy is
a Manchu, and the Manchus have never admired the
distorted foot of a Chinese woman; but as they
went through their musical drill one could not help
thinking that the neat coat buttoned across and
reaching to the knees over loose trousers was about
as ideal a dress as has ever been invented for women.
His Excellency did not fail to make his own daughter
stand up, and asked her many difficult questions,
which she answered very well in a calm and collected
manner.  After showing us these schools His
Excellency said that we must stop a third day and see
many of the other schools in Nanking.
</p>

<p>
Next morning I was most distressed to find that
my friend Mr. King, His Majesty's Consul, was too
unwell to attend the interview which I was to have
with the learned men of Nanking, and so with some
trepidation lest I should make sad faults in my
manners without his kindly guidance, I drove up
to the Yamen.  There I was received by a crowd
of officials, among whom were two great Confucian
scholars with the Hanlin Degree, an authority on
Buddhism and an authority on Taoism, whose
knowledge subsequently proved to be extremely small.
</p>

<p>
The courtesy of the Chinese officials, the charm of
their manner, the mixture of dignity and good nature
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
which is such a characteristic of their behaviour,
makes controversy with them delightful.  I do not
think any one who has known them can be but
greatly attracted by their courtesy and kindness.  All
Chinese are courteous, but the Chinese literati,
perhaps naturally, greatly excel their fellow-countrymen
in this charming characteristic.  I should add that
the two interpreters who were provided were men
whose mastery of English was only equalled by their
wide learning and pleasant address.  One of them
had been in England and was indeed a great traveller;
he had ridden all through the passes which separate
India from Chinese Turkestan; he belonged to a very
great family, and traced his descent from one of the
leading pupils of Confucius.
</p>

<p>
We discussed Confucianism first.  I set the ball
rolling by asking what was meant by the phrase
"superior man."  The position was a pleasant one;
I was there to be instructed, and could therefore ask
as many questions as I chose.  The "superior man"
is a translation of a phrase in the Chinese classics
which perhaps might be better translated "ideal
man"; at least so I gathered from these gentlemen;
and that in the works of Confucius and Mencius his
qualities are fully described.  With great joy the
whole party fell upon the question, and next minute
they were engaged in a courteous polemic as to how
exactly they should describe the "superior man," and
the answer came that he must be a conscientious man,
a man very true to himself, charitable, just and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
truthful.  When they were pressed as to whether wealth
was at all necessary to the "ideal man," they
indignantly repudiated the suggestion; the "superior
man" might equally be a beggar sitting by the
roadside or a Viceroy sitting in his palace.  It was
more interesting when they were asked whether he
need be a learned man.  There was some doubt and
hesitation in the answers; the doctors again consulted
with one another, and the answer came, "No, learning
was not at all necessary."  I asked whether the
"ideal man" might be a non-Chinaman, and it
was held that he might belong to any race.  But
the next question was far more difficult for them
to answer.  Nothing that they had said prevented
the "superior man" being a Christian; a Christian
might be true and conscientious and charitable.  I
quoted the case of a foreign doctor living in their
city, and asked how he failed to come within their
definition of the "superior man," but the Hanlin
scholars could not agree; no Christian, in their
opinion, could be a "superior man."  But my
interpreter added that he himself did not endorse this;
to his mind any man who fulfilled the requirements
should be classed as a "superior man."
</p>

<p>
We then changed the conversation to the question
of "whether Confucius believed in God or not?"  I
had been instructed in this controversy by one of the
most learned missionaries in China, Dr. Ross of
Mukden.  They maintained, as he told me they would
maintain, that the Heaven of Confucius meant Reason.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
But Reason cannot possibly punish the guilty, though
the guilty might be punished by their want of Reason.
And as Confucius refers in several places to Heaven
as a power that punishes, the definition is obviously
incorrect.  It dates from a philosopher called Chu.
Again the learned men were absorbed in controversy,
every one enjoying such a discussion.  The greatest
number still held to the doctrine that Heaven meant
Reason, but a certain number held that it meant a
personal God.  It ended in the controversy becoming
quite heated, and in a copy of Dr. Legge's translation
of the Chinese classics being fetched, so that I might
fully understand their different points of view.  In
the end we agreed that there was a considerable
force in the argument that Confucius believed in a
personal God.
</p>

<p>
When I further asked how Reason could possibly
punish a bad man when he was dead, and how it was
that many a bad man, as we all know, died in wealth
and prosperity, they answered that after death his
memory was punished by his bad deeds coming to
light.  I suggested that if a man was dead this did
not matter to him, and that Confucius' assertion that
punishment followed sin implied a future life.  When
they were further asked whether Confucius taught
that all secret sin should one day be made public,
there was an eloquent silence, and we dropped the
subject.
</p>

<p>
We then went on to discuss Buddhism, and a
pleasant old gentleman leaning on a stick was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
brought up to instruct me in the doctrine of
Buddhism.  It was obvious from the jocose and
pleasant way the matter was treated, that this
was very different ground to the philosophy of
Confucius.  Then, though everybody was courteous,
everybody was keenly and seriously interested, but
Buddhism was regarded as a most amusing topic;
I was assured that only a few women believed in
it, and that none of those in the room gave it the
slightest credence.  They explained to me why
the Dalai Lama came to Peking.  Two of the
disciples of Buddha had been reincarnated, and the
greatest of those two was the Dalai Lama, but it
was impossible to tell in which baby the
reincarnation took place without coming to the Mongol
Temple at Peking; then lots were cast and the
matter was settled.  I had my doubts whether the
old gentleman was accurate, but clearly no one else
in the room had the smallest acquaintance with the
subject; they made a marked difference between the
Buddhism of the Lama Temple at Peking and that of
the Monastery at Hangchow, which they called Indian
Buddhism, and said the district was often named
Little India; but when I tried to discover how many
sects of Buddhists there were in China, or what
was the nature of their tenets, I could get no
information from these gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
His Excellency Tuan-Fang joined us at this
moment and asked whether I could possibly read
a Sanscrit manuscript that he had discovered, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
which, from the Chinese notes appended to it, he
gathered referred to Buddhism.  He also wished to
discuss the origin of Chinese characters; he had a
theory that they came from Egypt, and he showed
many rubbings of hieroglyphics which he had had
made from monuments in Egypt to prove his point.
</p>

<p>
But I wanted to ask some questions about Taoism.
I had tried to understand Taoism and had found
it extremely difficult, and I thought these cultured
literati could give me some assistance.  I was
soon undeceived.  Nobody believed in Taoism, and
they knew nothing of its doctrine or of its worship.
They suggested that the Taoist priests were often
to be found in a Buddhist temple, but one scholar
said that that was only because the Taoist priest
liked to make a little money by selling incense sticks.
</p>

<p>
Then His Excellency turned the tables and began
asking questions about Christianity.  The thing that
troubled him was that the Bible which he had
read was in such poor style.  He wanted to know
whether I thought our Blessed Saviour habitually
wrote in good style or not.  I explained that He had
originally spoken in Aramaic, which had been
translated into Greek, and from the Greek into English,
and then had been retranslated by Englishmen into
Chinese, so naturally the Chinese version could but
inadequately represent the full beauty of His words.
It is worthy of notice how much the Chinese mind
is attracted by all purely literary subjects, and how
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
little they care about physical science.  For instance,
when the Viceroy asked me about the sun standing
still in the Book of Joshua, which led us into natural
science, it was immediately obvious that this was a
subject in which these gentlemen took no interest.
</p>

<p>
We then repaired to a sumptuous luncheon
prepared entirely in Chinese fashion.  The viands were
exquisitely cooked, and comprised bird's-nest soup,
shark's fins, white fungus, and all the usual Chinese
delicacies.  The hospitality of my host made me
regret that the capacity of a human body is limited,
and if it were not for the excellency of the Chinese
cooking, dyspepsia must have been the result.  Over
luncheon we discussed all manner of topics, and I
noticed how extremely sensitive my hosts were to
the slightest want of manners.  They referred to
a mutual friend, a European, in the severest terms
because he lacked in courtesy.  They discussed also
the question of foot-binding.  They were convinced
that the habit is being given up, and they assured
me that it did cause girls excruciating agony.  They
said the younger generation of Chinese gentlemen
would not marry women with deformed feet.
</p>

<p>
I left the Yamen a great admirer of the culture
that could make men so pleasant.  If they lacked
directness as controversialists, they were most
agreeable in their extreme civility and their
imperturbable good humour.  I shall always look back to
my days at Nanking as some of the pleasantest of
my life.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<h4>
ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSIONS IN CHINA
</h4>

<p>
It is only just to put in the forefront of the
influences that are Christianising and changing China
the French, Italian, and other missions of the
Roman Catholic Communion.  Our first contact
with the wonderful work which these missions are
accomplishing was in French China, at that very
interesting but most pestilential locality, Saigon.
We were received with the greatest kindness by the
Sous-Gouverneur at the French Government House, a
palatial residence worthy rather of an emperor than
a governor, compared to which Government House
at Hong-Kong seemed but a cottage.  Yet even
there life was hardly bearable even under an electric
fan.  The heat was stifling.  It had been impossible
to drive out except in the middle of the night, and
so we were entertained by being taken by night to
see our first glimpse of Chinese civilisation, for the
Chinese once dominated this country, and have left
their civilisation behind them.
</p>

<p>
Driving back, our French host regaled us with
stories of the people, and incidentally mentioned
the great power which Christianity has in these
colonies.  We were much impressed by his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
testimony to the efficiency of mission work, for the
French official is far from favourable to the Roman
Catholic Church.  He told us not only was a large
part of the country round Saigon Christian, but
Christianity was such a vital thing that the Church
had no difficulty in getting sufficient money to build
splendid churches.  Next day I called on the Bishop.
He was a splendid type of Roman Catholic missionary,
with his white beard and his courtly manners.  We
found several such in our wanderings, for Catholic
missions are spread all over China, and have been
founded many years.  He spoke of the great
success of the work, and thought that the hostility of
the French Government was in some ways preferable
to their patronage, for the personal lives of
many of the officials are far from admirable.  Their
morality would better befit our Restoration Period
than the twentieth century.  A Governor's mistress
was a person recognised and courted by official society,
and it was perhaps to the advantage of the mission
that in the native mind Christianity was dissociated
from such evil doings.
</p>

<p>
I asked him how he supported the climate,
which we had found barely endurable for two days.
He replied that the climate was quite cool to the
missionary who lived a chaste and temperate life,
but that the Government found it terrible for their
officials.  This may be quite true, but still I think
chaste and temperate Englishmen would find the
climate of Saigon intolerable.  We do not make
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
sufficient allowance in speaking of a healthy or
unhealthy climate for the origin of the missionary.  If
he comes from Marseilles in the South of France, it
is not perhaps wonderful that he should find the
countries which are not hotter than his native land
in the summer quite tolerable.
</p>

<p>
The history of Catholic missions is apparently
to be divided into three periods.  The first period
terminates in 1742 and commences with the first
mission of the Jesuits under Father Ricci in 1584.
During this period the Roman Catholic missions,
directed by a series of men of extreme ability,
endeavoured and nearly succeeded in converting
China from the "top downwards," for, owing to
their wonderful scientific attainments, the
missionaries received important posts under the Chinese
Government.  The fall of the Ming dynasty and the
conquest of China by the Manchus only served to
improve their position; they directed not only the
Government astronomical observatory, but they even
superintended the arsenal and became the
cartographers of the empire.  They had many adherents
chiefly among the learned.  Christianity, like
Confucianism, had commended itself to the intellect of
the country.  In pursuit of this policy they
endeavoured to harmonise Christianity with the thought
of the literati of China; such a process was no doubt
extremely dangerous, but they thought that it was
possible to tolerate ancestor worship and the
adoration of Confucius; whether they were right or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
whether they were wrong, while they did it
Christianity had many educated adherents.
</p>

<p>
Another kind of missionary next appeared in
China, the Dominicans, who made up in fanaticism
for what they lacked in wisdom.  These men offended
every prejudice of the Chinese; they taught the
harshest and narrowest form of the Roman Catholic
doctrine.  The foot was to be made to fit the shoe,
and not the shoe to fit the foot.  There were riots
and troubles, and the Dominicans blamed the highly
placed Jesuits and freely accused them of having
denied the faith and of having accepted high office
as the reward for unfaithfulness.  Appeals were made
to Rome.  Rome, many thousands of miles away,
wavered, unable probably to understand either the
controversy or its importance.  The heroism of
missionaries travelling over miles of sea and being
shipwrecked in their endeavours to reach Rome reads like
a romance.  But in 1742 the matter was finally
settled by Benedict XIV. in a Bull "Ex quo
singulari," and the Jesuits were defeated&mdash;a defeat
which was completed by their suppression in China
in 1773.
</p>

<p>
With their defeat the Roman missions entered
on the second period of their history.  They were no
longer directed by very able men, and they became
rather the Church of the poor than of the rich.
They experienced constant persecution, and, to gain
weight and position, they finally accepted the French,
who were then in the zenith of their power, as their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
patrons.  Such a course necessarily involved that
they must do all they could to further the French
interests, and the Roman Catholic missions became
more and more an adjunct of French diplomacy,
defended by France and on their side advancing
the interests of the French.  It is impossible to say
exactly when this policy began.  Louis XIV. had
sent large gifts to the Emperor of China, but he
does not seem to have had any intentions beyond
giving countenance and weight to the Roman Catholic
missions.  Some one pointed out to Napoleon I. the
great value of China, and the man of great ideas,
always dreaming of that Empire in the East which he
was never to found, clearly thought there was
something to be made of this.  He helped the missionary
societies with funds&mdash;it is curious to think of
Napoleon I. as the supporter of foreign missions.
This act came, like most other French secrets of
the time, to the ears of Pitt; and he managed that
the information should reach the Emperor of China,
and sent through a safe channel advice that the
Emperor of China should look upon the Roman
missions as dangerous and France as a "wicked
power."  Whether this advice would have been
taken to heart or not is doubtful.  Roman missions
were unpopular in China; still they had powerful
friends; but the discovery of one of their
missionaries with maps of China intended for the use of
foreign countries convinced her of the truth of the
English suggestion, and Roman missions were put
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
down at the beginning of the nineteenth century
with a relentless hand.  In 1840 there broke out
the first foreign war between China and the West,
and after this Catholic missions became more and
more an appanage of French policy.  Whether the
French had distantly intended the conquest of China,
or whether they merely looked upon China as an
outlet for her trade, they used the Catholic
missions as a means whereby French interests should
be pushed.  Certainly the author of <i>Les Missions
Catholiques Françaises</i> does not hesitate to suggest
that France was rewarded for the protection of
missions by an increased trade.
</p>

<p>
In 1842, as the result of a war, a treaty was
signed to which we have before referred, and in 1860
it was followed by another.  Both gave missionaries
extensive rights.  Can you wonder that the
peace-loving Chinaman, looking back on history, finds it
difficult to understand why the preachers of the
gospel of love should have been so often followed by
the armies and fleets of the military races of the
West?  The coping stone to this policy of propagating
Christianity by the power and influence of a foreign
nation was placed by an edict which just preceded
the Boxer movement.  That edict astonished even
the Roman Catholics, for the author of <i>Les Missions
Catholiques Françaises au XIX. Siècle</i> speaks of the
extraordinary surprise it was to the Roman Catholic
body.  This edict ordained that bishops and priests
should have official rank in China; that the bishops
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
should be equal in rank to viceroys and governors,
and the vicars-general and the arch-priests should be
equal to treasurers and judges, while the other priests
should be equal to prefects of the first and second
class; and that if any question of importance arose in
connection with the missions, the bishop or missionaries
should call in the intervention of the Minister or
Consul to whom the Pope had confided the protection
of the Catholics.  The edict closes with three injunctions.
First, that the people in general were to live at
peace with the Catholics; secondly, that the bishops
should instruct the Catholics to live at peace with the
rest of the world; and lastly, that the judges should
judge fairly between Catholics and non-Catholics.
</p>

<p>
This edict can perhaps be regarded rather as a
victory of French diplomacy than of the Roman Church.
French diplomacy had converted the whole of the
Roman Catholic work into an agency for the national
aggrandisement of France; the Roman Catholic
Church had sold herself to the French Government;
her old traditional policy of employing the powers
of this world to propagate Christianity had involved
her in this position; and she had presented
Christianity to her converts as something which,
however great its spiritual gain, had also very real
temporal advantages.  The Church was a great society
which would defend you in this world just as it would
give you promises of security in the world to come.
So she had instituted a regular system by which her
adherents were defended in any lawsuit or attack.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
This interference in lawsuits was, however, not
peculiar to the Roman Catholics.  It is an old
Chinese custom&mdash;a custom in which both Romans
and other denominations have acquiesced; still it
was exaggerated by the Roman Catholic Church till
it brought down upon her the anger of the Chinese
official world.
</p>

<p>
It is hard for a Westerner, with his ideas of an
independent court of justice, to comprehend the
system.  A lawsuit is not regarded in China as a
thing to be settled simply on its merits.  They are
only a factor in the decision.  The general desire is
that, if all things are equal, justice shall be done;
but together with justice the judge has to consider
the social position of the litigants and their power of
vengeance or of reward.  The best analogy to a
Chinese lawsuit is an English election.  If you read
the speeches and addresses you will conceive that the
whole desire of a candidate engaged in an English
election is that justice should be done, but in
practice you soon discover that the influence of individuals
has to be considered as well.  A candidate who
always disregards justice is universally condemned;
but a candidate who wilfully offends powerful
people, who is not prepared to give and take, to
sacrifice a conviction here, to push forward a little
beyond the line of justice there, is equally unable to
gain the suffrages of the voters; and in China the
judge stands in the same position as the candidate
does in England.  If he is convinced that a certain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
cause is backed by very powerful people who can
secure him a better appointment and a higher salary,
or who if angered might even succeed in getting him
dismissed from his post, he decides the case in that
litigant's favour.  If, on the other hand, the parties
are about equally matched in influence and power,
like the English candidate he then considers the
justice of the case; and therefore the first thing a
litigant does is to try and secure all the influential
support within his reach.  Chinese officials told me
that they have to have their cards printed with "for
visiting purposes only" written on them, otherwise
they are stolen and used without their knowledge in
the furtherance of some lawsuit, and English
Protestant missionaries confirmed the story.
</p>

<p>
Though this interference in lawsuits is a universal
custom, its extreme use is peculiar to the Roman
Catholics.  To attack a Roman Catholic was to
bring the whole strength of his mission, with the
diplomacy of France behind it, against you.  It was
in furtherance of this policy that the Roman Catholics
were anxious to hold official rank.  An official will
not speak to any one below his rank; the missionary
finds access to the Viceroys very difficult; but if the
Roman Hierarchy had this high official rank, the
Bishop had only to pay a visit in his green official
chair, when, by the strict etiquette of China, he must
be received with all politeness, and his visit must be
returned.  To procure these privileges the Roman
Catholics were prepared to sell to France the large
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
and undoubted influence they had among many
thousands in China.  There is a certain poetic justice
in the Roman Catholic Church suffering from the
actions of the French Government at home.
</p>

<p>
Still justice compels us to remember that they
have not been alone in this policy.  Missionaries
of other faiths and other lands have both relied on
the defence of foreign powers and have interfered
with the lawsuits of their converts.  A Protestant
missionary from the Southern States of America
frankly defended the system.  He boldly asserted
that non-interference in a lawsuit would be simply
misunderstood by the Chinese.  When he was young
he had absolutely refused to interfere in a case where
a widow was being oppressed, and a non-Christian
Chinese gentleman had interviewed him, and after
some circumlocution, had remonstrated with him on
his hardness of heart, that he, a teacher of the
religion of love, should neglect the widow in her
necessity.  Still, the Roman Church, as in Ireland,
as in France, as in Italy, is an institution which is
essentially political; and the traditional policy of the
Roman Church has been followed in China with the
invariable result, first, that when the power of the
State is used to promote her tenets she grows strong,
and next when that power is withdrawn or becomes
hostile she feels the loss of the earthly support on
which she has relied and apparently grows weaker.
This is, however, only transitory; the Roman Church,
for instance, is growing stronger, not weaker, now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
that she has lost the support of French diplomacy, and
the missions have entered upon their third epoch when
they are preaching Christianity without any special
support of a foreign government and are succeeding.
For there are few bodies of people in this world who
are more heroic and devoted than the Roman
missionaries; they have died by fever, have been
massacred, they live on a miserable pittance; I was
told that one enlightened missionary, once a Professor
in Paris University, lived on £12 a year; and their
heroism and self-denial reaps a large reward.
</p>

<p>
Their most beautiful and most successful works
are the orphanages which they maintain.  They
accept any of those children whom the Chinese
mothers cast out to die, either because of their
poverty or because they are girls.  These children
are brought up with infinite care and kindness, and
are taught embroidery, lace-making, and other trades.
No more beautiful sight can be seen than one of these
orphanages, with the happy children hard at work and
rejoicing as only Chinese rejoice in pleasant labour.
When these children grow up they are married
to Christians, and from them springs a native
Christian population, which has never known any of
the horrors of heathenism.  As a rule they live in
small societies.  I believe there is an island on the
Yangtsze which is entirely peopled by Christians.
The work may be great, but the cost is great too.
Many a life has been laid down so that these
children might be Christians.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
</p>

<p>
I recall one scene at Ichang.  There rises near
the town a great orphanage, and when we visited
it, we found the French sisters looking weary and
whiter than their white robes.  An epidemic of
smallpox had broken out in the orphanage, and out of
140 orphans, 28 had died of small-pox, besides which
the sisters had suffered themselves from malaria.
One could but admire the devotion of these women
living far off from their own country, tending
children whom no one else would tend, and gaining
as their reward hatred and misunderstanding from
the Chinese.  A Bishop belonging to this mission had
been murdered, and a lay brother told me that it
was because they were accused of stealing children
to make Western medicine out of their eyes.  This
strange slander arises apparently from the desire, which
is not understood by the Chinese, to save and preserve
the lives of other people's children.  Chinese ethics
have no place for such altruism.  Your duty never
extends beyond your own relations, either by blood
or from official position.  There is another reason,
however, for this notion.  The Roman Catholics have a
system of native agents who are prepared to baptize
any child, whether of heathen or Christian parents,
who is dying.  This system is very well organised.
Some of these agents perambulate districts and some
remain at fixed points.  Perhaps not unnaturally the
Chinese cannot understand this methodical search for
dying children, and as a reason must be found, and as
the reason that seems most probable to the Chinese
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
mind is some form of personal gain, they have invented
this slander.
</p>

<p>
Whether we approve or disapprove the general
action of the Roman Catholics&mdash;and our feelings are
probably very mixed on this subject&mdash;we must
recognise that they are a very great factor in the
change that is coming over China.  For centuries
they have stood before the Chinese as associating
with Christianity the science and the knowledge
the Chinese have always admired.  The wonderful
work done by the Jesuits of the eighteenth century
has established a tradition of excellent scientific work
which is well maintained by the learned brothers of
the Ziccawei Observatory.  Many hundreds of lives
have been saved at sea by the splendid meteorological
service they have organised, and the sailor who cares
nothing for Roman or for Protestant walks down on
the Bund to see what the Ziccawei brothers can tell
him about the probability of a typhoon.  The benefit
of their service, though great, is not limited to the
number of lives of mariners that their science
preserves; their science is an object-lesson to the
Chinese&mdash;an object-lesson especially useful at a time
when materialism is taunting Christianity with
obscurantism.
</p>

<p>
Missionaries in the field do not entirely recognise
the connection that exists between their own work
and the work of other denominations.  The man on
the mission field sees his bit of work, and realises that
it is a failure or that it is a success, but he does not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
realise how intimately associated that success or
failure is with world movements over which he has
but the very slightest control.  These world
movements are dependent on many factors that must be
beyond his direct knowledge, and one of the factors
that influence the success of Protestant missions is
the wide influence of Catholic work.  Conversely
every new Protestant mission that opens the door
of a school or a college probably tends to augment
the number of Roman Catholics in China.  The
question put to the Chinaman is not, "Will you be
Roman or Protestant?"  That was the question that
was put to the European in the sixteenth century.
The question is, "Will you become a materialist or
a Christian?"  And the answer he makes must be
largely affected by his experience of the intellectual
efficiency and high moral tone of those he calls
Christians.  I despair of persuading my Protestant
friends that the reputation of the Ziccawei brothers
is a valuable asset in evangelical work, and I equally
despair of persuading the Roman Catholic that the
splendid educational establishments of American
Protestantism is one of the reasons why their numbers
are increasing by leaps and bounds; but the
Chinaman would probably think the remark self-obvious.
</p>

<p>
How small the differences appear that we think
so profound was first brought home to me as we
passed through the Red Sea on the French mail in
company with a body of Coptic schoolmasters who
were going to civilise Menelik's subjects in Abyssinia.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
As it was Sunday morning these young men came up
to me to ask an explanation of the ceremony of ship
inspection which is performed with some pomp by
the French captain on that day.  With a wholly
exaggerated idea as to the religiosity of the French
they had concluded that this was a Christian
ceremony, and when I had explained to them that on
a French ship it was illegal to have a service, they
were distressed, for they explained that though they
had been educated in many different quarters, they
were all in agreement on religious matters.  One had
been educated in the Protestant College in Beyrout,
and another had been educated in the Jesuit College
at Cairo, which, he added in explanation, is practically
the same thing.  This statement would be regarded
as accurate by the average Chinaman.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, no one can doubt the importance of
Roman Catholic work in China.  They now claim to
have over a million of adherents, served by nearly two
thousand priests, and when one reads that they declare
that they have made in Peking alone thirty-three
thousand converts in one year, one realises what a
power they are in the Christianisation of China.  In
the West such figures would mean the downfall of
Protestantism, but in China such figures mean the growth
of a common Christianity which all denominations can
influence and in which all denominations can have a
share.  Remember, though a million Christians sounds
a vast number, it is small compared with the four
hundred millions who now form the population of China.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<h4>
OTHER MISSIONS
</h4>

<p>
Though the Roman Catholic missions were first in
the field by several centuries, it must not be supposed
that they are now the only Christian influence at
work.  The work of other bodies is extensive and
very important.  The pioneer society was the London
Mission, which began work under Dr. Morrison in
1807.  Very soon after them the British and Foreign
Bible Society began work in 1812.  But no great
mission work was undertaken till after the treaty of
1842.  Then society after society sprang up.  One
of the earliest was the Church of England Missionary
Society, which has a very extensive work, especially
in Eastern China.  Among the earliest of its
missionaries were the two veteran brothers, Bishop
Moule and Archdeacon Moule, who have for half a
century ordered its ranks with courage and
self-denial.  The Presbyterian Mission was not long
behind them, and the American Methodist Missions
began work practically at the same time; and so
missions have gone on increasing till there are over
sixty missions, over and above the Roman Catholic
Missions, at work in China, with a staff of over
three thousand five hundred white workers and a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
body of converts numbering over a quarter of a
million.
</p>

<p>
The people who are opposed to missions will
immediately say what a regrettable thing it is that
Christianity should present such a picture of division
to the heathen, and they will probably find a great
number of people who are sympathetically inclined to
missions and who cordially agree with them.  There
can be no doubt that it would be far better if the
Christian Church presented a picture of unity to the
whole world.  It would be far better that we should
all think alike; but if we cannot think alike, it would
be a great mistake to seek for unity by encouraging
people to suppress their convictions.  Unity is very
valuable, but it can never be so valuable as are truth and
honesty.  Far better to accept the truth and say that
there is a difference of opinion rather than by denying
the truth and concealing the divisions that really exist
to give a false appearance of unity.  If this is true of
other parts of the world, it is even more true of China.
Her national tendency is to regard conviction as of
little importance, and on the other hand to lay great
stress on uniformity.  Perhaps one should say that
this is the natural result of an autocratic
government.  Autocratic government naturally encourages
the doctrine that everybody should agree with the
autocrat.  Now the advance of the West has been
accomplished by encouraging liberty of opinion,
therefore the people who are to expound the great
doctrines of Western civilisation rightly appear before
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
the Chinese world showing a great diversity of view.
</p>

<p>
It is most regrettable when liberty is exchanged
for tyranny, when the acceptance of one opinion
involves the persecution of another, when Christians
not only differ but persecute and thwart each other's
efforts.  This may be an evil in our own land, an
evil which we hope will soon pass away, but in China
that evil does not exist except between the Roman
and the non-Roman bodies.
</p>

<p>
There are great differences of opinion.  The
extreme Ritualist position is ably represented in China,
the ultra-Protestant position has equally able
representatives, and I have seen them uniting in the
Shanghai Conference in defence of the Apostles'
Creed against a Latitudinarian attack.  To the
Chinese I think they present not the aspect of
different bodies opposing one another, but rather
different regiments of the same army intent on
overthrowing the same enemy; and though they are
clothed in a different uniform and use different
weapons they serve under the same general.

</p>

<p>
The American bodies are far the richest.  Whether
it is that the United States is a richer country than
England, or whether it is that they are more liberal
in their gifts to missions, or whether it is that they
are more inclined to spend their money on Chinese
missions, the result is certain, the American missions
have every advantage that money can give.  Their
splendid educational establishments are a feature in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
many towns.  If the American missions have the
advantage of the English missions in money, both British
and American missions have an equal right to claim
that they have as representatives in China a body
of self-denying and enthusiastic men.  It would be
invidious to make any reference to the excellence of
any special mission.  Among the British missions,
the London Mission claims indeed the greatest number
of converts, though the Church Missionary Society
does not come far behind it.  Again, the Presbyterian
Missions and the China Inland Mission have a
large and growing work.  The latter is a most curious
development of missionary policy.  The missionaries,
differing in many doctrinal particulars, have agreed
to co-operate under the name of China Inland Missions
in the west of China; they have agreed not to oppose
each other in any way, and to give each other mutual
support.  They are under the head of a director who
organises and arranges their separate provinces.  A
great feature of this scheme is that they effect a
large saving in the expenses of mission work by
co-operation.  A white man cannot live in many districts
in China without a supply of medicines and some
Western comforts; they arrange for the forwarding
of these things, and help the missionaries in their
journeys.
</p>

<p>
Bishop Cassels is at once a member of this mission
and of the C.M.S.  He is a splendid example of the
courage that is necessary for missionary work.  He
has been through the Gorges of the Yangtsze twenty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
times.  Once he was unwise enough to forsake the
small native boat in which he habitually travels and
to entrust himself to a steamer, which, under the
pilotage of a German captain, was going to attempt
the rapids.  They did very well till they happened
to bump on a rock, when the captain lost his head,
and instead of beaching her, he tried to anchor.  The
water surged in and soon put out his fires, thus
preventing him from raising his anchor, with the result
that the ship gradually filled and sank and the
passengers had to swim for their lives.
</p>

<p>
The S.P.G. Mission is excellently manned, but
suffers much from want of pecuniary support.  I
cannot help feeling that if it was but once realised
how important it is that the capital of China,
whither resort all the intellectual and ambitious men
of China, should thoroughly understand the logical
position and the reverent worship of the Church of
England, that the necessary funds would be
forthcoming.  It is most desirable that China should
understand that there is a <i>via media</i> between Rome
and Protestantism.
</p>

<p>
Without wishing in any way to detract from the
necessity for missions to other parts of the world, we
may point out that China has at this moment a very
special claim.  No one would say that the mission
work in India or in Africa demands within the
next few years that the intellectual side of
Christianity should be thoroughly explained, but this is
actually the case in China.  The intellectual men of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
China who gather together at Peking are now
demanding to know what truth there is in Christianity.
They must be answered by men as intellectual as
themselves, who will be able with courtesy and force
to convince them that Christianity is a religion that
is thoroughly consistent both with modern science
and with the intellectual progress of the world.
</p>

<p>
No better mission to undertake that work can be
conceived than the North China Mission of the
Church of England.  This mission, under the
leadership of Bishop Scott, represents with dignity the
tolerant and reverential attitude of the Church of
England.  One cannot help thinking that if he had
a sufficiently liberal support, so that he could have a
college where he could undertake the education of some
of those future statesmen of China who are desiring
to understand Western things, that his mission might
be the means of encouraging a movement towards
Christianity among the scholars and statesmen of
China.  That distinguished Baptist missionary,
Dr. Timothy Richard, told me that he thought that the
dignity of the Church of England, especially as so
ably represented by Bishop Scott, might be a great
asset in convincing the Chinese literati that
Christianity was a religion which would harmonise with
their love of order and dignity.
</p>

<p>
Of missions of other nations we saw one or two
examples, but they are few in number if you except
the Roman Catholic Missions.  It is rather a pity
that the Scandinavian Missions do not throw all their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
effort into work in Manchuria; few races would endure
the bitter cold of Manchuria better than they, and
Manchuria is readier to accept Western ideas than
perhaps any other part of China.  She has felt and
realised the pressure of the West, she has suffered
under the burden of Russian domination, she has
seen the Westernised armies of conquering Japan
put to flight the northern invader.  As we stood on
the 203 Metre Hill and realised on that shattered
hill-top how Manchuria has seen the full force of
the destructive power of Western civilisation; as we
counted the wrecks that then lay at the mouth
of the harbour; as we looked at each shattered
homestead, yes, and at the bones that were still
unburied, we felt that the great land of Manchuria
has a special need that some one should show her
that Western civilisation can indeed produce
something more lovely than shells and bayonets.
</p>

<p>
I am happy to be able to say that a splendid work
is being carried on by the Presbyterian Missions;
they have shown to the Northern Chinese another
form of courage than that which was shown by the
warriors of Russia and Japan.  Two stories remain in
my mind among many.  First a story of the old days
before Russia had made the Trans-Siberian Railway,
before the Japanese had for the first time taken Port
Arthur.  A British mission doctor was at work.  The
Chinese, <i>more suo</i>, had determined to get rid of this
example of the mercy of Western civilisation.  They
did not dare to kill him openly, so they sent a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
messenger who feigned to have come from a sick
man out in the country.  The doctor and his Chinese
dresser, unconscious of the plot, readily obeyed the
summons.  They noticed that a child followed them,
and they did their best to induce him to go home, but
he would not.  When they arrived at the village inn
they discovered that the sick man did not exist.
They were in doubt what to do, when suddenly the
door was thrown open and several of the soldiers
of the Viceroy's bodyguard rushed in, and seizing
the two, they declared that they had stolen a child
to make medicine out of his eyes.  They then
proceeded to torture the doctor by tying his hands
behind his back and suspending him by them to
the roof.  Such was the agony that the doctor lost
consciousness.  They then took him down, and he
was put into a loathsome Chinese prison, where he
was exposed to mental torture as severe as the
physical torture which he had already endured.
He was told that he would be beheaded, and every
preparation was made, and then at the last moment
he was taken back to the prison.  This was repeated
till they thought they had shattered his nerve, and
then he was allowed to go free.  With that calm
courage which has so often characterised the action
of the members of the missionary body he returned to
his work fearless of death and torture.
</p>

<p>
Another story, which has its humorous side, was
also told us.  At the time of the Russian
occupation of Newchwang, the Russians had, as we have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
described above, been "pacifying" the town, and a
crowd of terrified Chinese had taken refuge in the
Presbyterian Mission compound, where there was
only one lady.  She, however, came from Belfast, and
had all the courage of the Northern Irish in her veins.
A body of Russian soldiers came towards the mission
with the intention of shooting the Chinese.  She took
a horsewhip in her hand, and regardless of the loaded
rifle or the bloody bayonet, commenced to belabour the
soldiers with it.  There are some things which are
understood by all nations, and the use of the
horse-whip was at once appreciated by the Russians, who
fled before her, leaving her a victor and the saviour
of her Chinese friends.
</p>

<p>
I know people say that women should not be
exposed to the risks of a missionary's life, but the
answer is that were women not employed, half the
mission work would be left undone and the heroism
with which women have endured death and danger has
been no small factor in the spread of Christianity and
in producing the change in China.

CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<h4>
THE EFFECT OF WESTERN LITERATURE IN CHINA
</h4>

<p>
Among the influences that have awakened China, outside
the great lesson of political events, none has been
more influential than literature in its many branches.
The Chinese have always been a literary race.  They
invented printing about the same time that the
savage Saxons welcomed the first book written by
the Venerable Bede, and the influence of literature
has therefore held sway many hundred years in
China.  But for the last six hundred years there
have not been many works of original thought
produced in native literature.  Most of their writings
have been commentaries on the Classics following
along the beaten paths, or works of poetry full of
references to the Shi-King or the classic poetry of
the Chinese.  The literature of China is characteristic
of her civilisation.  It is confined by an artificiality
which has its origin in an inordinate respect for the
past and an absolute distrust of the future.  Every
book looks backward to the period when China's
thought was pure and great.
</p>

<p>
This period continued till the Anglo-Saxon
influence made itself felt through its missions.  Very
early in the history of Protestant missions it was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
perceived that in a country like China some other
appeal must be made than could be made by the
white missionary.  A nation reverencing the printed
page to such a degree that men will carefully pick
up a piece of paper and put it on one side rather than
trample it heedlessly, for fear lest that piece of paper
should contain words of wisdom, is obviously a nation
that can best be reached through printed matter, and
so Dr. Morrison, the pioneer of Protestant missions,
devoted the greater part of his missionary life to
translating the Holy Scriptures.  The matter was not
so simple as might appear to those who are only
conversant with the civilisation of younger and less
artificial races than the Chinese.  It is not enough
to translate a work into Chinese; the spoken language
is nowhere used for literature.  The literary language
commonly called Wenli probably never was spoken,
and is so full of artificial rules of construction that
it is only after many years that a man can hope to
write it efficiently.  Chang-Chih-Tung says that it
requires ten years for a Chinaman to become an
efficient translator.  That does not mean that it takes
ten years for a Chinaman to learn English, but ten
years for a man to be able to put into good Chinese
the thoughts that he has learned from the West.
</p>

<p>
The written language of China, it should be
remembered, is not a language in which sounds are
portrayed by means of signs as it is with Western
languages.  Each character represents an idea, the
only analogy in our language being the numerals and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
some few signs we have for simple words such as
"cross" or "and."  Therefore when new ideas are
developed new signs are required.  These can be
created out of old signs.  For instance, I understand
that a railway engine is called a fire carriage.  This,
by the way, caused great confusion of mind in a
certain district to the Christian converts who were
conversant with the story of Elijah, for some of them
erroneously concluded that Elijah left this earth in
a railway train.
</p>

<p>
Another instance of the difficulty of expressing
new things was afforded when a certain mission
started work in China.  They were in some perplexity
as to the title that they should choose for their
society.  They wanted to convey to the Chinese that
their denomination claimed especially to feed the souls
of men.  They explained all this to an educated
Chinaman, and quoted some well-known texts.  He
immediately wrote down two characters, and assured
them that they represented what they had said
about the spiritual food that they provided, and
would also be very popular with the Chinese, as
indeed it proved.  The moment they opened the door of
the chapel they were besieged by hundreds of Chinese
of the poorer class, who, after listening for a short time,
went away discontentedly.  The missionaries found out
afterwards that the title they had been given literally
translated was "Health-giving Free Restaurant," a
most attractive title to the hungry Chinaman.
</p>

<p>
There is indeed another way of representing new
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
words.  The word can be borrowed bodily from
another language and pronounced in a Chinese way,
and the word-signs which best represent the sounds
can then be employed.  This is often done with proper
names.  For instance, a great Chinese statesman told
me that he referred to Sir Edward Grey in his
despatches to China by three signs which had the
three sounds Ga La Hay, but this system is obviously
open to misconstruction, because the reader might be
tempted to give the words their normal meaning.  I
believe that such terms as X-rays and ultimatum
have been so adopted bodily into the Chinese
language.  Ninety per cent., however, of the new
word-signs which go to make up what the Chinese call
modern style are new combinations of ancient ideographs.
</p>

<p>
One of the pioneers in this translation work said
at the Shanghai Conference that the first thing a
missionary had to do before he could convert the
people was to convert the language.  Until he had
invented a new set of word-sounds to convey
Christian ideas, the preaching of Christianity laboured
under the very greatest disadvantage.  The "term
controversy," that is, the controversy as to what sign
should be chosen to signify the Christian's God, was
an example of this.  It arose first in the Roman
Communion and afterwards gave great trouble to other
Communions.  The choice lay between three
terms&mdash;one signifying originally "Supreme Ruler," one
"Heaven," and the last "Spirit," none of which quite
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
expressed our idea of God.  What Christians felt was
felt by other translators also, and one of the great
causes of advance in China has been the formation
of a language which can now thoroughly express all
the ideas that are characteristic of the West.  Many
of these word-signs come from Japan.  Japan, using
the same written script as China, and having accepted
Western thought, is more easily able to compose
the word-sign necessary for its expression, and it
is in this way among many others that the influence
of Japan will be very important if not paramount in
far Eastern countries.
</p>

<p>
Every missionary body has tried to produce
Christian literature; the great difficulty has been to
get the translator.  The method usually employed is
to get a Chinese graduate, too often not a Christian,
and to make him, under careful supervision, write
down the phrases rendered by the missionary into
Chinese.  Even so the difficulties are very great.
The object of literature is differently understood
in the West and in the East.  A Chinese scholar
who was very conversant with both languages
explained the difficulties by the following anecdote.
Engrossed in the study of Western knowledge he
had neglected his Chinese literature, and was in
imminent danger of failing in his examination.
Happily for him the night before his examination
he read a classical author much admired by
connoisseurs but not much read owing to his great
obscurity of expression.  A particularly recondite
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
phrase dwelt in his memory because it had cost
him so much trouble to discover its meaning.  Next
day he used the phrase in his paper, and when his
paper was returned to him with the marks of the
examiner upon it, it was obvious that it was this
phrase, surrounded on all sides by the marks of his
examiner's approbation, which had been the means
of his passing that examination.  Subsequently he
went to Chicago University.  "There," he said,
with the quiet humour of a Chinaman, "I learnt
that the object of an essay was to convey an idea
in as simple a manner as possible.  This is not the
Chinese plan."
</p>

<p>
One of the pioneers in this work was the body
which is now called the Christian Literature Society
for China.  Assisted by a brilliant staff, Dr. Timothy
Richard has produced a great mass of excellent work
which has profound influence on thought in China.
No better test can be found of the wonderful work
that they have done than the fact that the greatest
statesman that China possessed, and also her greatest
Confucianist scholar, should refer to one of their
publications, <i>The Review of the Times</i>, as one of the
causes of China's enlightenment.  The Christian
Literature Society has not, however, been the only
labourer in the field.  Good work has been done
by the Religious Tract Society, which has depôts in
various parts of China for the sale of good literature;
and there have been other societies which have also
published books, including the Mission Press, belonging
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
to the Roman Catholics, which is situated at Hong-Kong.
</p>

<p>
But in speaking of Christian literature we must
not forget the various Bible Societies which have
done such varied and excellent work in China, chief
among which has been the British and Foreign Bible
Society.  Far beyond where the white missionary
could reach, the productions of this Society have
penetrated; even right across the deserts of Mongolia
have their colporteurs carried their wares.  Of the
conversations which I had with various Chinese
gentlemen one was especially remarkable as a testimony
to their activity.  My interlocutor was one of those
fat lazy men who enjoy the good things of life and
care but little for serious matters, and yet I was
surprised to find that he was obviously acquainted
with, at any rate, some of the tenets of the Christian
faith, and I wondered how this indolent man had
obtained such knowledge.  I felt certain that his
dignity would never have permitted him to have
talked to a Christian missionary, much less to have
listened to a Christian sermon.  At last he
incidentally mentioned that though a Confucianist he
was well acquainted with the Gospel of St. Mark.
I could not well ask him how he had obtained it,
but no doubt it had come to him through the means
of the British and Foreign Bible Society.
</p>

<p>
We happened upon another example of the
influence of the Bible Society.  We were coming down
on the boat from Canton, and, walking on the Chinese
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
deck, I saw a man smoking opium and reading an
English book.  As I saw he knew English, I addressed
him; under the influence of opium, he was
wonderfully communicative.  The book turned out to be
St. John's Gospel, and he was reading about our Lord's
Crucifixion.  He had only picked it up because he
wanted to improve his English, but he was deeply
impressed by it, and his comments were most interesting.
He asked me whether it was true that when our
Lord was crucified He had stood alone against all
the power of the Jews and the Romans, and when
he received an answer in the affirmative, he added,
"Then He must have been Divine, for no man who
was not Divine could have stood alone."  To the
Chinese mind, which is incapable of any separate
action, which is powerless unless it has the moral
support of the Government, of a Guild, or even of
a secret society, the story of the Crucifixion appeals
most strongly as an example of Divine strength of
purpose.  This strange contrast between the
opium-smoker and the Bible was typical of China.  The
forces of good and evil were wrestling together for
the possession of that man's life; the forces of good
having been put into his hands no doubt by the
instrumentality of some Bible Society.
</p>

<p>
But the good work that has been directly done
by all these societies has been greatly augmented
by the good work that they have done indirectly
through the medium of some of their converts.  A
body of Christian young men determined to start
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
a publishing house on their own account, the object
of which should be that the published books, both
translations and original works, should best convey
to the Chinese mind lofty and noble ideas in Western
thought.  If these books were not intended to be
definitely propagandist they were at least calculated
to teach the ethical system of Christianity.  The work
of the Shanghai Commercial Press has had a great
influence on the thought of China; from thence
has issued forth a mass of literature both for
schools and for the general public which has
introduced Western thought to the Chinese.  Many of
our standard authors have been translated, and the
Chinaman, moved by his love of literature, is now
becoming intimately acquainted with every literary
activity of our civilisation.  When one looks at those
strange word-signs it seems hard to believe that any
one could read them with ease and rapidity; yet
Chinamen say, though writing is a matter of great
difficulty and requires much time, reading the
characters is quicker than reading our system of printing,
each idea being conveyed by one sign, instead of, as
in our language, by many letters.
</p>

<p>
These signs are apparently things to which
sentiment attaches.  We heard a most interesting debate
at the Conference of the Anglican Church at Shanghai
as to the title by which the Anglican body should
be generally known, and it was instructive to watch
the differences between the views of the English and
the Chinese minds on the question, as the debate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
was translated by a most able interpreter, Mr. Tsen.
We began with what threatened to be a rather
dreary Anglo-Saxon debate between the High and
the Low Church.  One felt the old atmosphere of
the sixteenth and seventeenth century of English
history very present in the room.  The debate was
on the question as to whether the word "Catholic"
should form part of the title.  I need not detail
the arguments that were advanced on both sides;
they are too well known.  Then we turned to the
Chinese translation, and at once the fires of
Smithfield and the thunders of the Reformation disappeared
as by magic, and the blue-robed men from all parts
of China woke up to an interest that was as
extraordinary as it was instructive.  We gathered, by
means of our interpreter, two or three most
interesting facts.  First, there was unanimity in the room
that the title should not in any way, indirectly or
by allusion, convey the idea that the Anglican
Church had anything to do with England.  The
view of China for the Chinese obviously commanded
the assent of all in the room; even those who had
been influenced the other way by their teachers, had
to allow that the word Anglican would be fatal to
the popularity of the Church.  When "The Holy
Catholic Church of China" was proposed as a title,
it was suggested by the white men that it savoured
of insolence, as implying that the other communions
did not belong to it.  This met with no favour from
the Chinese.  Their argument was simple; we are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
all going to be one body in a short time, so the others
can share in our title if it is a good one, and if it is
not, we can share theirs.  Then there was this
feeling, which it was impossible for a stranger to
appreciate, that each ideograph had a sentiment attached
to it, and that therefore the title must be composed
of ideographs which had not merely a suitable meaning
but also a beautiful association.  In the end they
adopted for their title the ideographs that are used in
the Creed for the Holy Catholic Church, not
meaning thereby that they were the only branch of the
Catholic Church in China, but that they were a
true branch of the Catholic Church.  There was
another point made obvious to the onlooker, a point
which will be dealt with further on in this book,
namely, that owing to the different policies of the
missions, the American body dominated in debate
because they were represented by an extremely able
body of Chinamen, while the English missions had
as Chinese representatives only men of ordinary
education.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the question of literature.
Though literature has been instrumental in
disseminating both the truths of Christianity and the
noble ethical teaching of the West, it has also been
instrumental in disseminating much that is evil and
corrupt in Western literature.  Perhaps it is not
extraordinary that the Japanese bookseller finds
that the erotic novel from Paris sells more freely
when translated than the English story whose whole
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
motive depends on a proper comprehension of the
Christian ethical position.  <i>The Dame aux Camélias</i>,
by Dumas, is the most popular of the Western works,
and one cannot but tremble to think what incalculable
injury such stories will do to a nation which does
not understand the relative positions in which those
works are held by men of high character in the
West.  Chang-Chih-Tung refers in one of his works
to the apparent immorality of Western thought;
and if we grant that books like these are typical of
Western thought, we shall not be able to wonder at
his conclusion.  Through the distorted medium of
such translations Western civilisation must seem
wholly detestable.  The Chinaman will naturally
say, "Your boasted morality is merely a hypocritical
covering for a profligacy which we should never permit
in our land."
</p>

<p>
Not only are French novels translated, but all the
works which Western thought has produced against
the Christian faith.  Haeckel's "Riddle of the
Universe" is a typical example.  In literature, as
in every other department of life in China, two
elements of Western civilisation strive for mastery.
On one side there are arrayed the powers of Christianity
and the interpretation of Western civilisation
as a product of Christian thought; on the other
side lies materialism, and the explanation of Western
civilisation as a natural result of evolution which is
developing an irreligious but most comfortable world.
If China listens to the first, she will become like other
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
nations, a great power, not only rich, but honourable,
true, and merciful, the result of the teaching of
Christian faith and ethics.  If she listens to the
second, the efficiency of China will be rendered
terrible by a low morality, which will not only
desolate and depress many millions, but even have
a deleterious effect on the West which so mistaught her.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<h4>
MEDICAL MISSIONS
</h4>

<p>
After literature perhaps we should place medical
missions as one of the most effective ways of
placing before the Chinese the difference between
our civilisations and of showing them the truth and
beauty of Christianity.  There are three or possibly
four reasons why medical missions are a right and
effective way of conducting the Christian propaganda.
First, they are an object-lesson of the love
which Christianity inculcates.  In school teaching
we find that the object-lesson is the most efficient
and easiest way of getting the human mind to
understand a quite new idea; medical missions are
object-lessons of the essential character of Christian
teaching.  Chinese ethics are very distinct in
limiting the duty of man to certain well-known relations.
They are five in number: the relation of the sovereign
and minister, of the husband and wife, of the father
and son, of the elder and younger brother, and of
friends.  No Confucian recognises the universal
brotherhood of man; that is solely a Christian doctrine.
Thus Confucius reproves the man who wishes to
offer sacrifices to some one else's forefathers; that
appears to him to be as officious as the duty of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
offering sacrifices to his own ancestors is important;
a man has no obligations to any one else but to those
who stand to him in one of these five relations.
Very different is the tone of the Apocrypha, which
is not of very different date, and which puts burial
of the dead among one of the first duties of
man without specifying the necessity of any close
relationship.
</p>

<p>
The action of missionaries in coming to China
was therefore wholly misunderstood by the Chinese.
They were regarded as merely the emissaries of
foreign powers, sent to spy out the land.  Considering
the way in which the Roman Catholic missions
did as a fact identify themselves with the foreign
policy of France, one cannot altogether wonder that
the Chinese attributed to their mission the selfish
principles they themselves would have followed.
The first purpose, therefore, served by medical
missions is to demonstrate to the Chinese that
Christianity has higher ideals than Confucianism.
</p>

<p>
Their second great object is one that must appeal
to the heart of everybody who has been in China.
It is impossible to work among the Chinese without
being rendered miserable by the appalling amount
of suffering and misery that exists at the present
day.  The poverty of England cannot be spoken
of in the same breath nor can in any way be
compared with the poverty of China.  Deplorable
as is the condition of many individuals in England,
harsh as is the action of some of our casual wards,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
any one who has studied both will freely allow that
the poor in England are rich compared to the poor
in China.  Among the vast crowd that wanders
along the North Road to London, you will scarcely
see one without boots; there is scarcely one who
does not get a piece of bread to eat when he is
hungry; there are none who are suffering from
untended wounds or unalleviated sickness.  The
workhouse infirmary will always open its doors, however
harsh the Guardians, to those who are absolutely
ill.  But in China, starvation is quite common.
Missionaries tell you how at certain junctures they
have travelled along a road, passing man after man
lying at the point of death, and those who are sick
have too often no resource but to wait with patience
the pain and death they foresee as their fate.  The
missionary feels, as he preaches the doctrine of
love, that he cannot consistently ignore these
suffering multitudes.
</p>

<p>
The third reason why medical missions are
maintained is because they are a means of approaching
people who otherwise would not hear the Christian
truth.  The man who has successfully healed the
body has some reasonable hope to expect that
the patient will accept that medicine that he offers
to cure the soul.  So medical missions have been
started in every place.  We visited many excellent
medical missions, from chilly Mukden to torrid
Canton.  There are many stories told how in the
days when the Chinese would not listen to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
missionaries, the medical missionary obtained that
hearing which was refused to his clerical brothers.
I was told one medical missionary found that the
moment that he was extracting teeth was the
moment when he could best advance his teaching.
I have never heard the story substantiated; unless
the Chinese are very different from us, one would
have thought that the teaching would have had
a distinctly painful association.  Perhaps he took
as his thesis the extraction of sin from the
character.  His success was equalled by that non-medical
missionary who had the advantage of having a set
of false teeth; these he used to take out before
the astonished coolies and replace them; then having
attracted their attention by this manoeuvre, he took
up his parable on the need for taking away their
sins from them and for putting new life into them.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese coolie loves a jest, and once he is
on the laugh he will, unlike his English brother,
be much more inclined to attend to serious
teaching.  One of the missionaries who understands this
trait of the Chinese best is Dr. Duncan Main of
Hangchow, where we spent two most interesting
days seeing his hospitals and work and visiting
his patients.
</p>

<p>
There is no better testimony to his great work
than his obvious popularity.  Wherever he goes
there are smiles and greetings.  He explains as we
walk who are the individuals who salute him.  That
great fat man who stands bowing and smiling is a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
merchant of some wealth; his wife has been in the
hospital; she has been tended by Dr. Main and by his
skill has been cured.  That old woman who stands by
him smiling is another ex-patient.  That young man
with an intellectual face and a dark robe is an old
medical student, now a doctor himself with a large
practice, and he has settled near Dr. Main's hospital.
And so his work increases and grows and the good he
does must live after him.  He takes us into the
out-patients' room; they are a motley crowd, with
strappings and bandages on various parts of their persons.
While they are sitting there a lay-reader expounds to
them the elements of Christian teaching.  What a
contrast to their minds must be the plain forcible
teaching and the simple effective remedies and
medicines of the Christians to the incantations and nauseous
compounds of their native doctors.  There is a great
doubt as to what is the nature of many of the Chinese
drugs.  They always prescribe a vast number, many of
which are apparently innocuous in their effect; they
always give them in large quantities, and do not in any
way attempt to isolate and extract the active properties
of the things they use.  You see a man eating a large
bowl of some nauseous compound and you are told he
is taking Chinese medicine.  You ask a captain what
his cargo consists of, and he tells you that it is largely
made up of Chinese medicine.  Some of the medicine
seems to be prescribed on the principle of our old
herbals; that is, there is a fancied resemblance
between the plant and the disease.  Others seem to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
come from well-known remedies administered in
various ways; ground-up deer's horns from the
mountains of Siberia has probably much the same
effect as chalk has in our pharmacopoeia.  But there
also seems to be some possibility that the Chinese
doctors have certain useful remedies which are
unknown to Western medicine.
</p>

<p>
There is a strange story told in Shanghai about a
certain remedy for a horrible disease called "sprue."  The
story is well known to every resident in Shanghai,
still it will bear repetition.  A certain quack called
"French Peter"&mdash;I do not know his proper name&mdash;habitually
cured sprue.  Cases which English doctors
had absolutely failed to cure, and which threatened
ruining a career or loss of life, he cured in a few
weeks.  He had two remedies&mdash;a white powder and a
black draught.  He himself was a most unattractive-looking
man.  My informant told me that his career
was being threatened by this horrible disease, and that
he was expecting to leave China in a week or two,
when some one suggested that he should try "French
Peter."  When they met, "French Peter's"
appearance was so unprepossessing that the sick man's
courage nearly failed him.  He had been for weeks
on a milk diet, and the first thing that the man said
to him was, "Look here, take these medicines and go
and have a good beefsteak for luncheon."  He decided
to try them.  He ate his beefsteak, he took the white
powder and the black draught, and I think within
three weeks was quite well.  "French Peter" would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
never tell his secret or where he got his remedies; at
least he used to give different accounts to different
people.  I believe he is now dead, but on talking the
matter over with some Chinese friends they assured
me that the remedies were well known to Chinese
doctors, and that "French Peter" had got them from
one of their compatriots.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Main deals with his patients in the same
cheery way that he addresses every one; a word or
two suffices to discover the nature of their ailment.
If the case is very serious, the patient is detained for
further examination; if it is trivial, it is attended to
at once by a native dresser.  For the rest he himself
prescribes.
</p>

<p>
Then he takes us up to the wards, and explains
that the great difficulty is to get the Chinese to care
for cleanliness.  That is the same story in every
hospital; they cannot believe it matters very much
whether the thing is kept clean or not.  The medical
students will proceed to handle anything after they
have washed their hands and think that the previous
washing insures asepticism, regardless of the fact that
they have touched many septic things.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Main's hospital is typical of mission
hospitals&mdash;Dr. Christie's hospital at Mukden, Dr. Gillison's at
Hankow, Dr. Cochrane's at Peking, and many others.  There
are also hospitals for women.  We saw many; the first
we visited, the Presbyterian Hospital at Canton, was a
good example, impressing us not only by its efficiency,
but also by the great service it performed to the suffering
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
masses of China by training women doctors, who are
permitted to minister to their sisters when etiquette
does not permit of male medical attendance.  The
lady who showed us round the hospital spoke English
fluently; she was dressed in the dress of the Cantonese
woman, which suited her profession admirably, as it
consisted of a long black coat and trousers.  Some hospitals
are reserved for the very poor; at Nanking, for
instance, Dr. Macklin showed us over his beggar hospital.
He follows the parable of the Good Samaritan most
literally, and wherever he finds a poor, starving, dying
man, he brings him in.  Clearly he cannot afford
anything but a limited accommodation for these poor
creatures, but he is on the whole most successful, and
there is many a man whom poverty had brought near
to death whose life he has saved.  As one looked at
those types of suffering humanity and realised the
good that Dr. Macklin was doing, one felt that the
days of saintly service were not over yet.
</p>

<p>
Another beautiful work is Dr. Main's leper
hospital at Hangchow.  It was a weird and strange
experience to hear those lepers singing our old
English hymns.  Leprosy, as my readers doubtless
know, does not often leave open sores; it slowly eats
away the body while it leaves the skin intact; and
so you see men without hands and arms yet with finger
nails upon the stump, blind men without noses, and
very commonly men whose voices are cracked and
broken.  These lepers are housed in an old temple,
in one of the most beautiful situations in China&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
situation which is supposed to be the original of the
landscape on the old willow pattern plates; and the
beauty of their surroundings contrasts strangely with
their hideous forms and harsh voices.  There was an
infinite pathos when by that blue lake and purple
mountain, those harsh but plaintive voices sang the
old tune of "Jesu, lover of my soul"; and though we
could not follow the Chinese words, the faces of
these poor sufferers were eloquent in expressing how
fully they felt the meaning of that hymn.
</p>

<p>
But above all we should mention the great work that
is being carried on by Dr. Cochrane at Peking.  He has
managed to induce all the medical missions in Peking
to unite in founding a great hospital&mdash;a hospital which
has received the approval of Government.  This
successful example of federation has solved a difficult
problem.  No doubt the efficiency of medical missions
in many a town is impeded by their want of unity.
A mission body will open a medical mission, and will
send out a doctor or even two in charge; one doctor
must go on his furlough, another is perhaps ill, and
the result is that the mission is closed.  The
commercial community are rather ready to point out
that the mission hospital is closed in the summer
when there is the greatest need for it.  The answer
to the taunt is the policy of federation.  While it
is next to impossible to keep open the mission
hospitals in an unhealthy climate with a limited staff,
it is perfectly possible to do it if the staff is increased.
Every doctor in Central and Southern China must
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
have a certain period of rest, otherwise he will not
be able to stand the enervating effects of a
semi-tropical climate; and however possible it is to keep
white men at work for three or four years without
a holiday, and I know commercial people claim that
this has been done in certain individual instances,
it is in reality the very poorest economy.  The
mission doctor is far too valuable a person to have
his life cast away by such a foolish policy of
extravagance.  He must have his rest every year
and his furlough every seven years.  But it is not
necessary that the hospitals should be closed if the
staff is big enough; a certain number of the hospital
staff can go on leave, and when they are rested, can
come back and allow others to go in their turn.
Dr. Cochrane has shown at Peking that such
federation is possible, and the China Emergency
Committee is making every effort to encourage a
similar federation in other parts of China.  Medical
missions are splendid examples of Christian charity
and love, but they are rather sad examples of the
lack of unity among Christian men.
</p>

<p>
Analogous to the medical mission are the missions
to the blind and the deaf.  The blind are a striking
example of how Christianity alleviates misery, for
the blind in China learn to read more quickly than
those who have sight.  The teachers of the blind
have invented a system of raised type by which the
Chinaman can read every word that is pronounced
in Chinese.  It is not our letter system, which they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
would find difficult to understand, but something
after the nature of the Japanese system.  Each
syllable is represented by a sign; so, strange as it
may appear, the blind man not having to study the
character learns to read more quickly than the
man with normal sight.  There is an excellent school
for the blind at Peking, under Dr. Murray's
superintendence.  There is another at Hankow, where we
saw a most striking instance of the beauty of holiness.
One of the masters at this blind school was a blind
man himself; he was a most ardent Christian; he
had been taught to play the organ, which, indeed,
is a speciality at that school, many of the organists
in the mission churches in Hankow coming from it,
and one could not look upon his face without feeling
a conviction that his spiritual vision was as clear as
his physical sight was dark.
</p>

<p>
There is a fourth reason, and one which applies as
much to educational missions as to medical missions,
why both are fitting and proper ways to teach
Christianity.  Christianity claims to and does benefit
the whole of man, not merely his spiritual side.
Mankind cannot properly be cut up and divided into
spirit, mind, and body.  He is essentially one, and it
is most necessary that those who are learning about
our religion, should understand that while we claim
every benefit should come from the spiritual part of
our nature, we are prepared to show that we in no
wise despise the body, which needs religious care as
much as the soul.  Neither are we careless about the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
mind.  So the three parts of mission work go hand
in hand, for preaching and prayer will heal the ills of
the soul, the medical mission deals with the ills of the
body, and the educational mission makes the mind
healthy and strong.  We shall deal with the
educational side of mission work later on.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<h4>
MOVEMENT IN KOREA AND MANCHURIA
</h4>

<p>
One of the movements which will affect Christianity
all over the East has had its origin in Korea.  Just
as the suffering and miserable heart of the individual
man is that which Christianity finds most suitable
for its home, so it is with a nation.  It is at the
moment of national adversity and humiliation that
religious movements most readily rise.  Korea had
looked upon herself as the equal of Japan.  From
Korea came much of the civilisation which adorned
Japan before the great Western movement.  When
Prince Ito with the eyes of a statesman was realising
that Japan must either accept the domination of the
West or its civilisation, Korea was immovably
entrenched in her belief in her national greatness and in
her contempt for the Western world.  So Westernised
Japan has overcome her ancient rival and teacher, and
Korea is humbled to the very dust.
</p>

<p>
In many ways that humiliation is rendered more
poignant owing to the lack of sympathy between
the races.  Though they both have taken their
civilisation from China and have a common classical
literature, they are diametrically opposed in many
things.  The Japanese are essentially a clean race.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
They wash constantly; they will not enter a house
with their shoes on their feet.  No one who knows
them will accuse the Koreans of excess in cleanliness.
On the other hand, the Japanese very frequently
lack modesty.  Many are the stories that residents
will tell; and we have seen the Japanese women
clothed in the garb of Eve appear in the public bath
and even in the street.  On the other hand, the
Koreans may be corrupt and immoral, but they are
modest.  The women of Seoul as they walk through
the streets cover their faces with their green cloaks,
till one almost thinks one must be in a Mohammedan
land.  Those green cloaks are a perpetual reminder
of the ancient hostility between the races.
</p>

<p>
The picturesque story is worth telling.  The
Japanese, knowing of the absence of the Korean armies,
determined to surprise Seoul.  They thought they
had succeeded, when to their amazement they saw
the walls of Seoul covered with what they took for
warlike Koreans.  The ready wit of the women had
saved their town.  They had dressed themselves in
their husbands' clothes and so deceived their
hereditary foes.  The Emperor rewarded them by giving
them the right to wear the man's green coat, which
they wear not in coat fashion, but over their heads,
the sleeves partially veiling their faces; and as one
wanders down the main street of Seoul and watches
the modest but gaily-dressed crowd of Koreans&mdash;the
women in their green coats with red ribbons, the men
in white garments wearing their curious top-knots
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
and quaint hats&mdash;one understands the antipathy they
must feel for the short, muscular, soberly-dressed
Japanese who by his courage and daring has subdued
them and now tramples on their national
susceptibilities and ignores their national rights.
</p>

<p>
There are several missions in Korea, but there is
one which, <i>primâ facie</i>, would call for no special
remark.  It ministers to the white-robed Koreans in
the same way that many another mission ministers
to these Eastern peoples&mdash;teaching and preaching.
Externally there is nothing exceptional about the
missionaries.  I will not say that their mission is
uninteresting, but it is unexciting.  They are
Americans by nationality and Scotch by name and blood,
and they follow the national Presbyterian faith with
all its cautious teaching, with all its prim simplicity.
No one would regard them as the mission that was
likely to create a great excitement or raise a great
enthusiasm, neither indeed do they so regard
themselves.  Their conception of mission work was the
sensible and reasonable plan of converting a sufficient
number to make them teachers and preachers, and
then having educated them, to send them out to
convert their own fellow-countrymen.  In 1906 and
the beginning of 1907 they were filled with dark
forebodings for the future of Korea.  The temporary
occupation of Korea by the Japanese was obviously
going to be changed into a permanency.  The murder
of the Queen had shown what the Japanese would
do, and the victory over Russia had shown what they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
could do.  Korea was at their mercy.  Subdued yet
not conquered in spirit, the missionaries, knowing
their people well, foresaw that a bitter friction must
arise between the two races; that rebellions and the
consequent fierce repression must bring to their infant
church a time of great trouble; and so, like the wise
Christian men that they were, they took themselves
to the Christian's weapon, namely, prayer.  They
earnestly prayed that in some way a great blessing
should fall on their converts.  That prayer was
seemingly unanswered, the grasp of Japan was not relaxed.
Except for the wisdom and gentleness of the great
Prince Ito, there was nothing but oppression and
sufferings for the Koreans.  The Japanese army had learnt
not only their military art but their statecraft in
Germany, and the latter is traditionally harsh.  Break,
crush, and bully are the maxims which find general
acceptance in the Prussian Court.  Prince Ito,
however, was a great admirer of English imperial policy
with its maxims of justice to the weak, mercy to the
conquered, and reverence for all national traditions;
but Prince Ito could not control the Japanese soldiers,
and the moans of the oppressed Koreans echoed
throughout her land.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1907 the Presbyterian Mission
held what is called its country class&mdash;that is to say,
that the men who had been converted were
summoned from all the country villages to the town
of Pyeng-Yang, and there they attended for several
days' instructions in the Christian faith.  This
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
excellent rule enables Christians who believe but who
are ignorant to acquire a more ultimate knowledge
of the truths of Christianity.  These meetings are
wholly unemotional; they are in no sense revival
meetings, nor even devotional; they are essentially
educational.  Their object is to teach and not to
excite.  For the Scottish-American has a double national
tradition that knowledge is strength.  These
meetings had been held one or two days; they had
followed their usual uneventful if beneficial course,
and showed every probability of ending as they
had begun, when one of the Koreans rose from the
centre of the room and interrupted the ordinary
course of the meeting by asking leave to speak.  As
he insisted, permission was given him.  He declared
that he had a sin on his conscience that forbade him
listening to the teaching of the missionaries in peace,
and that further he must declare this sin.  The
Presbyterian missionaries do not encourage this kind
of open confession of sin, but still to get on with
the meeting and to quiet him they gave him leave
to speak.  He then declared that he had felt some
months ago a feeling of bitterness towards one of
the missionaries, a Mr. Blair, who was our informant.
Mr. Blair assured him that so far from feeling that
there was any need for this confession he regarded
the matter as trivial, and hoping again to bring the
meeting back to the point he suggested that they
should say the Lord's Prayer.  Hardly had he
uttered in Korean the words "Our Father," when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
a sudden emotion seemed to rush over all those who
were there present.  The missionaries described it as
at once one of the most awful and one of the most
mysterious moments of their lives.  They were not
revivalists; they had not encouraged it; they did
not believe in it; they disliked an emotional religion
with which they had no sympathy; and here they
were in the face of a movement which was beyond,
not only their experience, but that of the greatest
revivalists.  They tried to stop it, but unavailingly.
The Koreans, unlike the Chinese, always sit upon
the floor, and as the missionaries looked out over
the meeting from the platform on which they stood,
they saw the faces of their converts racked with
every form of mental anguish.  Some were swinging
themselves forward striking their heads on the
ground, hoping, as it were, to obtain by
insensibility peace from their torturing thoughts; some
were in the presence of an awful terror; some were
leaping up demanding to be heard, longing to free
their souls from the weight they felt would crush
them; others with set faces were resolutely
determined not to yield to the inspiration of the spirit
which suggested that they should gain relief by
frank confession.  The missionaries having failed to
bring the meeting to a close, submitted to what
they felt was the will of a higher Being, and
the meeting went on till fatigue produced a
temporary and a partial rest.  Though the meeting was
closed, the missionaries learnt afterwards that many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
Koreans went on all through the night in agonised
prayer.
</p>

<p>
The next day they hoped the thing was over,
and that the incident might be reckoned among
those strange experiences which workers in the
mission field must occasionally expect to encounter;
but not so&mdash;the meeting next night was the same
as its predecessor.  They noticed several interesting
facts.  One, for instance, was, that the women were
far less affected than the men.  The movement did
not reach them till later, and never so fully.  Another
remarkable thing about this movement was that
though the Methodists are by tradition a revivalist
body, and though they have a vigorous mission working
in that town, yet the revival only spread to their
converts after many days, and then neither with the
spontaneity nor the fire with which it had been
manifested in the Presbyterian Mission.
</p>

<p>
Of the reality of the confession of sin there could
be no doubt.  One man, for instance, confessed to
having stolen gold from a local gold-mining company,
and produced the wedge of gold which he had stolen,
and asked them to treat him as he deserved.  The
manager of the company luckily was a European,
who wisely refused to punish a man who had so
spontaneously confessed his theft.  Many of the sins
that were confessed would not bear repetition.  Some
confessed even to such awful sins as that of murder
of parents.  One man in particular, a trusted servant
of the mission, resisted confession, and day by day
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
became more and more racked with mental agony,
till the missionaries feared that his health would
not endure the terrible strain of such mental anguish,
and they advised him to make a free confession of
his sins.  At last he came to them with a sum of
money in his hand; he had raised it by selling some
houses which he had bought as a provision for his
old age, and he confessed to the sin that was
torturing him.  He had done what is constantly
done in the East&mdash;he had peculated.  His position
had been that of an agent whom the missionaries
employ to make many of their small payments, and
out of each of these payments he had taken "a
squeeze."  With these he had bought the houses
which now he had sold.  He left the missionaries
happy in heart though empty in pocket.
</p>

<p>
This movement spread more or less over the
Presbyterian missions in Korea, but never with such
intensity as manifested at Pyeng-Yang.  We heard it
spoken of by a non-Christian Korean, a member of
the Court of the Emperor of Korea.  He had heard
of it, and said men were saying this movement is a
wonderful thing, for under its influence men confessed
crimes of which even torture would not have induced
them to own themselves guilty.  A Chinese merchant
also heard of it in Manchuria.  The man came down
to Pyeng-Yang, and happened to stop with the
Chinese merchants.  He mentioned that there were
Christians in Manchuria, and the Chinese merchants
immediately took an interest.  When he asked what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
they knew of the Christians, they answered, "Good
men, good men."  One of them was owed by a Korean
twenty dollars, who would only allow that he owed
ten, and the merchant having no means of redress,
had written off the debt; but when this revival
took place, the Korean came with the other ten
dollars together with interest, and what of course
would appeal even more to the Eastern mind, with
the frank confession that he had lied.  This practical
illustration of the effects of Christianity greatly
impressed the Chinese.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at Pyeng-Yang the movement was
over.  We went to some of their meetings.  They were
very common-place ordinary meetings.  All that struck
us was that there was a tone of reverence, a sense
of reality, which made one feel that Christianity was
as sincere in Korea as it is in our own land.
</p>

<p>
The movement has spread from Korea to
Manchuria.  In Manchuria the movement had not quite
the same spontaneity that it had in Korea; it
savoured more of the revival meetings of the West.
It needed the stirring words of a great preacher,
Mr. Goforth, to start it, yet there were one or two curious
manifestations of power.  One is worth telling.
One brother was heard expostulating with another;
he was asking why his brother had, forgetful of his
family dignity or "face," confessed to sins which
brought not only himself but his family into
disrespect.  The other answered, "When the Spirit of
God takes hold of a man, he cannot help speaking."
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
Two still more curious instances are worth
recording: one in which two soldiers who were not
Christians were so moved that they confessed their sins;
another which seems to prove the presence of a force
exterior to human influence or to the emotions caused
by eloquence or moving hymns.  An elder of the
Church had forgotten or been detained from going to
one of these meetings; when the speakers went to
inquire next day why he had not been there, he
asked them in return to tell him what they had done
at the meeting, and they told him that many people
had confessed their sins.  He was deeply interested,
and said: "I was sitting in my house at the hour of
your meeting; I suddenly felt as if all my sins were
laid before me, and I realised as I had never done
before my many shortcomings."
</p>

<p>
And so the movement has spread through Manchuria
to China.  If it has lost something of its
freshness, something of its force, it still remains a
movement that may accomplish great things.  No
one who has read the history of the Wesleyan
movement, and of the wonderful manifestations that
accompanied its commencement, will look without interest
and expectation for the work which this movement
may accomplish.  Let us hope that it will bring to
China a sense of reality in spiritual things which the
present materialist teaching threatens to eliminate
from her national life.

CHAPTER XX
</h3>

<h4>
THE FUTURE OF CHRISTIANITY IN CHINA
</h4>

<p>
At the great Shanghai Conference we always spoke
of the "Church in China," implying thereby that
there was to be one Christian body in the Chinese
empire.  This ideal is lofty and not impossible.
There is a reasonable expectation that the great
intellectual movement in China will render the Chinese
very ready to accept new ideas, and the rate of
conversion in China gives one reasonable hope that the
new ideas may be Christian and not those of Western
materialism.  If China becomes Christian there will
no doubt be a great tendency to accept the unity of
Christianity as an essential doctrine.  As a race they
clearly tend towards union as much as the
Anglo-Saxon race tends towards disunion.  The British
empire has been held together by its fear of its
enemies; the Chinese empire has been held together
through their natural love of union, which is the
dominant characteristic of the race.  Remove the
enemies of the British empire and she will
naturally divide, but force the Chinese empire apart and
she will naturally return to one body.  Chinese
Christianity will, if it is truly Chinese, tend to one
body.  This truth, which I think would have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
allowed by the whole Shanghai Conference, opens up
a train of thought which is full of foreboding and
yet of hope.
</p>

<p>
One obvious criticism of what was said of the
Church in China was kept largely out of sight at
the Shanghai Conference, namely, that as the Roman
Communion far outnumbers the whole of the
non-Roman Communions put together, the Church in
China, therefore, if it is to consist of all Christians,
will be something very different to what the majority
of those present at that Conference would like.  Some
men maintain that the Chinese love of unity will not
go so far as to compel the union between Protestant
and Catholic, and that in China the schism which has
rent Christianity in twain in Europe will be continued.
I would ask those who think thus if they think
this is desirable even if it is possible.  Once foreign
influence and support has been removed, would not
such a division soon produce a state of great friction,
resulting probably in the destruction of the smaller
body.  But it is most improbable; a race which
has habitually put together Taoism, Buddhism, and
Confucianism will have no difficulty at all in uniting
Romanism and Protestantism.  I do not mean to say
that Rome will conquer; it does not seem likely.  The
power of the Romans is great when they are preaching
our common Christianity, but their peculiar doctrine
of the pre-eminence of Rome is most unattractive
to the Chinaman.  After all, Rome is a very small
place to a man who lives in China.  Think how little
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
we know of ancient Chinese history, and realise how
little China knows of the history of our civilisation.
Home at the present day is to the Chinaman merely
the capital of Germany's weakest ally.  The reasoning
of the universality of the Roman Church, always
faulty, seems almost ridiculous in China.  The
Chinaman on one side is conversant with America, on the
other side she is in touch with India, while on the
north she has a frontier which stretches for thousands
and thousands of miles between her and the great
Orthodox Church of Russia.  One's eyes naturally
turn to this immense line of frontier between
Confucianism and Christianity, and one wonders how any
Chinaman can possibly think of Rome as the one
Catholic Church.  If the Roman Church, with its
foreign domination and its tacit acceptance of the
fact that only members of the Italian nation can
receive Divine authority to guide the Church on
earth, is unattractive to the mind of the man who
lives in the Far East, on the other hand its ornate
and dignified services must be most attractive to
a race whose national philosophy puts pre-eminent
weight on dignity and decorum in dress and
demeanour.  If the Roman Church could give up
her Latin services, could frankly become a national
Church which owed no obedience to any Pontiff outside
China, one would regret the possibility but one would
have to allow the probability of her complete
domination over the Chinese empire.  Again one's eyes
turn to the northern frontier, and one asks oneself
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
whether that great Orthodox Church, the dignity of
whose services is without parallel, and which frankly
accepts the national Church as a reasonable Christian
position, will not one day be a large factor in the
future missionary work in China.  After what we
had seen and heard at the Centenary Conference,
and after we had realised the great extent of the
Roman work, we felt that till one understood why
the Russian Church conducted no missionary work
one could not understand the whole missionary
problem; for when the Russian Church does undertake
such work, her geographical position must render her
important.
</p>

<p>
The whole of this question is of the greatest
interest to the student of missions, but especially to
an Anglican.  The great value of the Anglican
position has always seemed that, to use an election
phrase, we offer a platform on which all those who
call themselves Christian might possibly unite.  The
great rent which divides Protestant from Catholic
seems not only to make it impossible for Latin
Christians to unite with the Teuton Protestant
Churches, but also renders it hard for the latter
to unite with the great Churches of Eastern Europe.
Of course all this has only an academic interest in
England, but in China with its rapidly growing
Christianity and an intellectual revolution surging
forward to unknown possibilities, all this is of vital
interest.  What will Chinese Christianity be?  Is it
to be an ornate Christianity to which the converts
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
of Rome and possibly the converts of the Orthodox
Church will adhere, an ornate Church sullied no
doubt with the faults of her parents, a Church
possibly attractive to the Buddhist, for he will not
need to traverse any great distance in thought to
enter her portals; or is it to be a great Protestant
Church, cold and bare, vigorous and energetic, a
Church in which the uniform of the Teuton mind
will sit badly on the Chinese convert, a Church
which may in many things represent truly the will
of our mutual Master, but a Church which leaves
the Oriental cold and miserable, while it practically
tears from our Bible those endless chapters on the
decoration of Temple and Tabernacle, those constant
commands to an exact and ordered ritual.
</p>

<p>
I write with what the Germans call "objectivity";
the Teuton within me dislikes ritual; but the
Chinaman is no Teuton, and the Chinaman loves ritual as
much as any man on earth.  No one who has been
received by a Chinese Viceroy in his Yamen can have the
very slightest doubt on this subject.  If the Protestant
bodies hope to force on the Chinese a non-ornate
form of Christianity, they will be doing exactly what
the Italian Church did to the Northern races, and
which produced the great upheaval of the Reformation.
The Reformation was essentially the rebellion
of the Teuton mind against a forced acceptance of the
Italian view of Christianity.  To force on the Chinese
converts a Christianity shorn of all ritual and display
will produce in years to come some similar upheaval.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
There is yet a third possibility.  The Anglican position
affords the means of avoiding such an upheaval, and
of permitting a union of all Christians on the basis of
an ornate service and evangelical Christianity.  For
while it permits a service equal in dignity to that of
Rome or of Russia, it insists equally with the bodies
who pride themselves on the name of Protestant on
the supreme value of the Bible.
</p>

<p>
The very hope I have that Christianity will
conquer China makes me fearful for the future.  The
age of persecution is past, the blood of the martyrs
has been shed, and the seed of a Church freely sown.
But after the age of persecution comes the age of
heresy, and to preserve Christianity in China from
future dangers, not only is union necessary, but a
well-ordered Church bound by creeds, respecting
tradition, which shall embrace all those Christians by
whomsoever they have been converted who love the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ.  The great danger
I fear for the future Church in China is one of
Eastern and not Western origin.  I do not fear the
domination of Rome.  I doubt that the Protestant
Communions will succeed in ultimately persuading
the Chinese to worship God in a bare building and
without vestments.
</p>

<p>
China and Japan will, if they are conquered by
Christianity, be neither Protestant nor Catholic any
more than we are Nestorian or Eutychian.  Their
divisions, their dangers, their struggles, will arise
from a wholly different set of circumstances.  I fear
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
the dangers will come from an effort to incorporate
Buddhism and Christianity in one religion.  This
is all the more probable as it has doubtless happened
before.  Nestorianism and Buddhism are the probable
parents of the present Chinese Lamaism.  It is,
however, not given for us to see into the future, but we
can look back into the past, and we can see that our
predecessors in the faith nearly invariably made the
mistake of supposing that the old dangers were going
to recur, and of therefore depending on the old
measures of defence.
</p>

<p>
The future Church in the Far East must fight her
own battles.  She must solve her own problems.  All
we can do is to hand over to her the truth in all
its fulness, and teach her to look for divine
guidance, to forget such words as Protestant, Roman
Catholic, Nonconformist, and Anglican; to learn
merely the word "Christian" and the word "Love."  If
Far Eastern Christianity will have its battles
to fight, it will have also its message to give to the
West, "that they without us should not be made
perfect."  It may be that the message of the East to
the West will be that as God is One, so must His
followers be; that strong and mighty as is the West,
there is in her an element of the very greatest
weakness; that the discord that reigns between
Christian and Christian, between race and race,
between class and class, is not the will of the Creator,
but is the result of the national sins of the white
races.  The Far East, with its greater power of unity,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
may illumine the West with a higher conception of
this great virtue, and the world may be a far holier
and happier place when the yellow race has preached
to the world the great doctrine of peace on earth and
goodwill to men.

THE NEW AND THE OLD LEARNING
</h2>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
</h3>

<h4>
EDUCATION, CHIEFLY MISSIONARY
</h4>

<p>
I have before had occasion to refer to the great
influence education has had on the awakening of
China, and I think the Americans can fairly claim
to have been the greatest workers in this field.  The
Roman Catholics have from time immemorial been
most careful to train children in Christian truth, and
they have wonderful institutions for this purpose.  In
1852 the Jesuits founded the College of St. Ignatius
for the education of native priests, and since that
day they have founded many educational institutions.
They have besides a very large number of primary
schools, intended originally merely to preserve their
converts from too intimate contact with the heathen
world, and they have also many higher schools.  In
those schools they teach modern knowledge, making
a speciality of teaching French, which they can do
with great efficiency, as many of their number belong
to the French nation.  In the German sphere of
influence there are Catholic schools where German
is taught; but though the work is excellent, it
cannot be compared with the work of the Americans,
who were really the pioneers of higher education in
China.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
</p>

<p>
When the American missionaries began to arrive,
a new departure was inaugurated in education.  The
school and college were no longer places where
Christians were simply educated; they were places
where Christians, confident in the truth of their
teaching, gave away to heathen and Christian alike
all the knowledge that the West possessed.  The
conception was bold; it was grand.  It showed a
statesmanlike grip of the situation and a courage
which can only come from a consciousness of the
strength of the Christian position, that
Christianity was not a narrow religion fearing free
inquiry.  Christianity, on the contrary, was a
religion which could only be appreciated by those
who had the very fullest knowledge.  These teachers
boldly declared that ignorance was the mother of
religious error, and therefore the duty of every
Christian was at once to remove ignorance and to
share with every one the knowledge that can alone
make the world capable of truly appreciating God's
power as manifested in every department of science.
</p>

<p>
So these schools and colleges grew up.  Those who
believed in this policy did not belong to any one
denomination, though they did belong to one
nation&mdash;America.  There were many opponents to this policy.
It was argued that the duty of the mission bodies
was to preach the Gospel, and that however
advantageous education might be, it was not the business
of the Christian to give it; but whatever doubt there
was then, facts have been too strong for those who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
opposed the educational policy, and any one travelling
through China realises more and more how the
Mission that has spent money on education is the Mission
that has the power of expansion.  The Mission that
has no educational system is always cabined and
confined for want of money and men.  They are always
writing home to ask that another man shall be sent
out; some one has broken down or some new
opportunity for work has been opened, and so "they must
press upon the Home Board the great importance of
sending out at as early a date as possible one or
more helpers."  The Home Board is always
answering those letters, expressing "every sympathy with
their anxiety," but in reality pouring cold water on
their enthusiasm, and pointing out that the supply of
men is limited and that the supply of money is yet
more limited.  Thus the opportunity passes and the
mission cannot expand.  The same little church
stands filled with converts; the same mission
building houses the tired out and climate-stricken white
missionaries.  Such a mission, while inspiring the
greatest respect for the heroism of the missionaries,
arouses also a feeling of despair.  How is it possible
that a mission like this can really solve the problem
of making Christianity a national religion?  How
can spiritual ministrations be performed by aliens,
supported by alien money collected from a possibly
hostile race?
</p>

<p>
A very different effect is made on the mind of
the onlooker when he comes upon some mission that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
has made education a speciality.  There all is life,
vigour and success.  One of the most successful of
the American missionaries, Bishop Roots, of the
Episcopal Church of America, explained the system by
which he is succeeding in making Christianity an
indigenous religion.  At his large college, presided
over by Mr. Jackson, many are heathen.  Some
go through the college and imbibe a certain respect
for Christian ethics, which will not only make them
a benefit to China but will make an intellectual
atmosphere sympathetic to Christian teaching.  Some,
however, will become Christians who will mostly go
out into the world and take their place, and a high
place too, in the leadership of the future China, as
much owing to the excellence of the teaching that
they have received as to the high morality which
is produced by their Christian faith.  Then there
will be a few who will feel a distinct call to go out
as missionaries to their own people.  These men will
have no temptation to become Christians for the
loaves and fishes, because, owing to the excellence
of the education that they have received and the
great prosperity that is dawning over China, they
could command a large salary in the open market.
These highly-educated clergy are able to go out and
put Christianity to the Chinese in a manner which
no white man could hope to equal.
</p>

<p>
What Bishop Roots told me can be well illustrated
by two little incidents.  In Hankow, where his work
is increasing by leaps and bounds, the Lutheran
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
Mission failed, and therefore it resigned the chapel
to him.  He accepted readily, and soon his Chinese
clergy were preaching to crowded congregations.  The
second incident was this: I expressed a wish to make
a present to one of these Christian scholars, and I
asked what books he would like to receive.  I was
told that such books as Balfour's "Defence of
Philosophic Doubt" and Haldane's "Pathway to Reality"
were the kind that would appeal to such young men.
Not only will these men carry the Gospel to their
fellow-countrymen far more efficiently than can the
alien, but they will to a great extent be able to live
on the subscriptions of their congregations, and so
the communion to which they belong will become
not only self-propagating but self-supporting.
</p>

<p>
To understand the importance of this controversy the
various aims of missionary education must be realised,
and it is because those aims are different that the
controversy has been confused and the value of
education as an assistance to missionary effort in China
misunderstood.  There are really seven aims: three which
are common to all missionary effort in all lands, and four
which especially apply to countries like China which
are passing through a transitional period of thought.
The three which are common to all missionary effort
are (1) evangelisation; (2) edification of the Christian
body; (3) education of preachers and teachers.  The
four that are peculiar to China in her present
transitional condition are (4) preparation of secular leaders;
(5) leavening of the whole public opinion; (6) opposition
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
to Western materialism; (7) association of
Christianity with learning.
</p>

<p>
The arguments for the first three are applicable to
every land.  Evangelisation can no doubt be carried
on most efficiently before the mind has received any
intellectual bias.  The Jesuit priest is reported to
have said, "If I have the child till he is ten, I do not
care who has him afterwards;" and therefore, as in
all the world so in China, the Roman Catholics have
always made a great effort to educate children.  They
have preferred those who have had no home-ties,
orphans and waifs, and have by this policy built up
a huge Christian population numbering over a million.
This population is thoroughly Christian in sentiment;
they have never known an idolatrous atmosphere, and
they live to a great extent by themselves in
communities.  While they are thoroughly Christian, they are
also absolutely Chinese; no effort is made to Westernise
the children in any way.  From this great Christian
body Catholic priests are drawn, and I believe so
completely Christian are they, that no difference is
made between them and white men by such an
important body as the Jesuits.  When other Christian
bodies began missionary work in China they also
started schools, but the difference of their schools
was that they aimed much more at the second than
at the first object.  The school was not merely a
place to attract homeless children and bring them up
as Christians; it was also intended to edify and adorn
with knowledge the children of Christians.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
Non-Christians were largely admitted, but I think that I am
right in stating that the object was much more
edification than evangelisation.  In a corrupt society like
China, where all knowledge is intermingled with vice,
it is inevitable that Christian schools should be erected
for the Christian body, and it is equally inevitable
that those who are non-Christians but who admire
the schools greatly should try and enter them.  The
feature of these schools for the most part, though not
invariably, in contrast to the earlier Roman Catholic
schools, is that Western education is to a certain
extent, varying in each mission, superadded to
Chinese learning; and therefore, though the school
is essentially a school for Chinese learning, the
children as a rule learn something also of Western
knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Out of these schools naturally arise others which
have the third aim of missionary education as their
object, namely, the preparation of preachers and
teachers who in the future shall be the real missionary
body of China.  Every thinking man realises that the
alien missionary can only exist in a brief transitional
period.  The true teachers of a race must be those
who are linked to it by ties of blood and tradition,
and nearly every mission has therefore set to work to
create a native ministry which is sooner or later to
take over the task of the conversion of China.  This
is regarded by many, nay, by most, as the great aim
of missionary educational work.  The degree of
preparation, however, differs widely in different missions.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
Some missions, drawing their teachers from the lower
ranks of society, are quite content to give them an
education which will enable them to lead and teach
the lower class among whom they move; other
missions held that the Christian teacher must not merely
he able to lead the ignorant but must be able also to
meet in controversy those who may be well equipped
with Western knowledge; and therefore while in some
missions the education of native pastors is conducted
solely in Chinese, in others the teaching is in English,
to enable the teachers and preachers to keep abreast
with the thought of Western countries and to defend
their land by pen and sermon as much against the
errors of the West as against the superstition of the
East.
</p>

<p>
It is in the preparation of these highly educated
men that an opportunity is given for the fourth aim
of missionary education in China: one which would
not be applicable in every country, but which is
vitally important in China, namely, the preparation
of secular leaders in China.  To understand the
importance of this we must be always reminding our
readers that China is in the midst of an intellectual
revolution.  She is passing through a period which
is in some way comparable to the period of the
Renaissance in Europe, but which exceeds it both
in importance and in danger, because in Europe, as
the name shows, it was essentially a reintroduction
of forgotten but not new knowledge with its
subsequent enlargement and development.  In China
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
the revolution is caused by the introduction of
foreign knowledge, which is absolutely inharmonious
and in many ways opposed to native thought.  In
Europe the foundations of knowledge were always
secure; it was only the superstructure that was
altered.  In China the very foundations are being
uprooted; the result is that China is at the present
without leaders, except for a narrow band of men,
who owing to the foresight of some Christians in
the past have received a Western education.  There
are plenty of old-fashioned leaders, who have led or
failed to lead the sleepy China of years ago&mdash;men of
considerable ability but in a state of great mental
confusion, owing to their powerlessness to
comprehend the many aspects of the civilisation which is
being forced upon them and which is unnatural
to them.  They cannot understand our currency
questions, our financial operations; they only dimly
realise the possibilities and problems connected with
military and naval armaments.  They yearn for the
years gone by, but an inexorable fate urges their
country forward into new positions, which bring with
them new responsibilities, new powers and new dangers.
China demands men to lead her through this terrible
state of confusion and change, and she turns round
to find the men who understand Western civilisation,
who have the character and the knowledge necessary
to deal with all these problems.  Just at this moment,
any man of ability who has an intimate knowledge
of Western things stands a chance of high
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
preferment.  It may be that this demand will be satisfied
by the number of students China has sent abroad
to be educated, but the size of China and the
great demand for men skilled in Western learning
make many of those having a most intimate
knowledge of China confident that this is an
opportunity that is still open, that it is still possible
to direct to some degree the minds and thought
of those who will lead China as statesmen, as
authors, and as men of learning.  The
production of these men can be carried on to great
advantage in the same establishment as that in
which the clergy are receiving their education;
the educated clergyman, the future pressmen and
statesmen of China are in this way brought in
close contact with one another, and even from one
establishment the good that may come to China is
quite incalculable.
</p>

<p>
This brings us to the fifth great aim of
education, the leavening of public opinion in China so
that Christianity will find ground prepared for its
sowing.  The destruction of superstition, the
production of Western ethics make Christianity a
reasonable instead of an unreasonable religion to those
who hear it preached.  Clearly to leaven public
opinion influence must be applied to those who will
control such powers as those of the press and the
school; the teacher and the writer are the men
who should be especially aimed at; and to attain
this aim, it is necessary to institute and maintain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
places where higher knowledge is taught rather
than only primary schools.
</p>

<p>
But there is another object, the sixth aim for
education in China.  One of the unpleasant features
in the revolution that is going on in Chinese thought
is the present introduction of Western materialism,
which to judge by the example in Japan, will grow
more rankly after transplantation.  The West has
a double aspect when seen from the East; it is a
Christian world where women are pure and men
are honourable; it is a rich world where there are
no moral obligations.  The first aspect is the one
that is represented by the missionary; the second
aspect is too often taught by the sailor and merchant
classes; and when the Chinaman asks what is the
thought and the base of Western teaching, the
Japanese materialist, pointing to the example set
by many Western lives, declares that Christianity
in Europe is like Buddhism in Japan, a religion
that at one time had many adherents but whose
influence is fast waning, and it is in resisting
this materialism that the Missionary College and
University perform perhaps their most important task.
</p>

<p>
The men who are to do this work must be
men most highly skilled in Western knowledge;
they must understand science and be able to meet
a follower of Haeckel in debate, they must be
competent to discuss sociology with disciples of Herbert
Spencer, and they must not be afraid to dip into the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
study of comparative religion; in addition, they must
be qualified to write excellent Chinese and to be firm
in their Christian faith.  The production of such men
as these should also satisfy the seventh and last aim
of Christian education: it will associate learning with
Christianity in the minds of the Chinese.  The
keynote of Chinese thought is its great admiration for
learning.  In China there is no caste or class, no
division except between the ignorant and the learned;
if Christianity is associated with ignorance, its
influence will be lost, and it is no mean object to make
Christianity and knowledge in the mind of the
Chinaman two parts of one great idea.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that as missionary societies lay weight
on one or the other of these objects, they will support
a different kind of school.  If their object is the first,
they will seek to educate the orphan and the waif,
and the school and the orphanage will be, as they are
in the Roman Catholic body, intimately joined
together.  If the object is to edify the Christian body
and to provide it with a suitable pastor, the
missionary body will erect primary schools for Christian
children and theological and normal schools to
complete their school system.  If, on the other hand, the
missionary body aims at leavening the whole thought
of China, of capturing China for Christ, or if it
aims at defending China against the terrible pest of
Western materialism&mdash;which will turn the light that
China now has into black darkness and harden her
for ever against Christian teaching&mdash;the High School,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
College, and the University will be the objects on
which the money will be spent.  This last has been
the object of the American bodies; and I think China
owes a great debt of gratitude, under God, to the
great width of thought and grasp of the situation
that the American mind has exhibited.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
</h3>

<h4>
GOVERNMENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
</h4>

<p>
One of the highest testimonials to the wisdom of the
missionaries in inaugurating an educational policy
has been given by the Chinese Government.  Imitation
is the sincerest flattery, and missionary education
has its imitator in no less a body than the Chinese
Government.  The Chinese have always loved
education, but the education they admired was
the literary education which had for its
commencement the Chinese character and for its end the
Chinese Classics; their system of teaching was
different from our own; they were far greater
believers in learning by rote than the most
conservative English schoolmaster who ever set a long
repetition lesson to his pupils.  It is a strange sight
to see an old-fashioned Chinese school, the boys all
shouting out at the top of their voices the names
of the characters whose meaning they do not
understand.  An essential part of the performance is the
clamorous shouting; the louder they shout, the
harder they are working and the quicker they
think they learn, so when the visitor surprises a
class their voices are not raised above a pleasant
and reasonable elevation, but after he has been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
discovered by the class, the shouts increase in
volume till the noise is only to be compared to the
paroquets' cage in the Zoological Gardens.
</p>

<p>
Another peculiarity of the school is that all the
pupils turn their backs to their master; the doctrine
being that if they were allowed to watch their master,
it would be perfectly impossible for him to detect
their many little acts of dishonesty.  The missionaries
at first painfully imitated these schools; they felt
that it was impossible to trust the children of their
converts to the heathen atmosphere of a Chinese
school, and at the same time they realised what
great value and importance was placed by the
Chinese on education.  These schools led on to a
sort of middle school called "shu-yuen," which
existed in all big towns, which in its turn led on
to four Universities, but they have been, I believe,
for some time in an inefficient condition.  Still for
good or for evil the system was there, and long
before our own new departure in education, the
Chinese were quite accustomed to the idea that
the boy who had sufficient ability might climb the
ladder of learning, from class to class, from school
to school, till at last he took the coveted Hanlin
Degree.  So high a value did the Chinese place on
education, that it was possible, and it did indeed
happen, that boys of the very humblest parentage
climbed that ladder till they reached the most
exalted positions.
</p>

<p>
The first sign of an alteration of this system was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
the book that was issued after the Chinese-Japanese
war by Chang-Chih-Tung.  That remarkable statesman
realised after China's crushing defeat that a
general reform was absolutely necessary if she was
to maintain her place among the free and independent
nations of the world, and he wrote a book entitled
"China's Only Hope," in which he strongly
advocated the acceptance in some measure of Western
education.  His scheme is the one which practically
obtains now in China, that is of making Chinese
learning the foundation on which Western education
is to be placed.  He had a great disbelief, like
most Chinese, in the difficulty of acquiring
Western education.  He writes: "Comparative study of
foreign geography, especially that of Russia, France,
Germany, England, Japan, and America; a cursory
survey of the size and distance, capital, principal
ports, climate, defences, wealth, and power of these
(the time required to complete this course ten days)."  It
is very hard for the Chinese literati to understand
the difficulties of acquiring Western learning.  Chang
was a man of no mean intellect, and one of the
reasons why he was so anxious to preserve Chinese
learning was because he realised the destructive
effect Western learning has on Oriental faiths.  He
hoped to preserve the ethics of Confucianism and
to attach to them the practical knowledge of the
West, which he realised was a necessity for China.
He summed up the position by saying, "Western
knowledge is practical, Chinese learning is moral."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P269"></a>269}</span>
</p>

<p>
The immediate result of this book was absolutely
the reverse of what its author intended.  A million
copies of the book had been issued, and it
circulated throughout China.  It raised a storm of
opposition, and probably was one of the causes
which produced the Boxer outbreak; but the failure
of Boxerdom and the Russo-Japanese war convinced
China that Chang-Chih-Tung was right, and his
book may now be taken as the book which best
expresses the intellectual position of the moderate
reformer.
</p>

<p>
He first deals with that very difficult question of
finance.  He proposes to finance the schools with a
wholesale disendowment of the two religions in which
he does not believe, Buddhism and Taoism.  He writes:
"Buddhism is on its last legs, Taoism is discouraged
because its devils have become irresponsive and
inefficacious."  He then suggests that seven temples out
of ten should be used both as regards their building
and their funds for educational purposes.  But he
has a sympathetic way of treating the disendowed
clergy of China.  He suggests that they could be
comforted by a liberal bestowal of official distinction
upon themselves and upon their relatives.  Who can
tell if Welsh Disestablishment would not be popular
if all the clergy were to be made archdeacons and
their brothers and fathers knights.  But he has
a historical precedent for disendowment&mdash;Buddhism
has apparently experienced the process of disendowment
three times; but as the last disendowment was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P270"></a>270}</span>
in 846, on our side of the world we should not
regard it as a precedent of much value.
</p>

<p>
In establishing schools he adopts five principles.
The first is one to which we have already referred,
that the new and the old are to be woven into one,
the Chinese Classics are to be made by some magical
process the foundation of the teaching of Western
education.  The second is a very un-Western but
possibly a sound way of looking at the question.  He
puts forward two objects of education: first,
government; secondly, science.  The first includes all
knowledge necessary for the government of
mankind&mdash;geography, political economy, fiscal science, the
military art, and though he does not mention it, I
suppose history.  The second is natural science, and
includes mathematics, mining, therapeutics, sound,
light, chemistry, &amp;c.  The third principle is one that
we rarely act on in our own country, namely, that
the child shall be only educated in the subjects
for which he has a natural aptitude.  The fourth
principle is one that applies absolutely to China; it
is the abolition of what is called the three-legged
essay, a complicated feat of archaic and artificial
writing which only exists for the purpose of
examination, something analogous to our Latin verses.
The fifth principle shows that China is as far ahead
of us in some ways as she is behind us in others.
China has passed beyond the stage of free education
to the stage of universal scholarship; all students
are paid, and this has brought about a great abuse;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
men study merely to obtain a living who have no
aptitude for learning, and on whom educational
money is really wasted, and so he abolishes payment.
</p>

<p>
His Excellency closes his advice with a suggestion
that societies for the promotion of education should
be formed.  The Chinaman loves these little social
clubs and gatherings.  His chess club, his poetry club,
his domino club, are national institutions.  Why not,
suggests His Excellency, have an educational club,
or as I suppose we should call it, a mutual
improvement society.  Thus wrote the great Viceroy who
more than any other man prevented the spread of
the Boxer outbreak from desolating Central and
Southern China.  During that Boxer rebellion all
advance was impossible, but after that overflowing
flood of disorder was passed, the reforms suggested
by Chang-Chih-Tung began to be seriously considered,
and on January 13, 1903, an Imperial Edict was put
forth renovating and organising, at least on paper,
the whole educational system of China.  It would
not be China if there were not a great deal of sound
sense in that edict; it would not be China if on
paper the organisation did not seem to be
perfect; it would not be China if as a matter of fact
the whole scheme were not to a great extent a failure.
</p>

<p>
The scheme was very complete.  It began at the
bottom and continued through every grade of
education to the top.  First there were to be infant
schools; these were to receive children from three to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
seven years old, and their object was to give the first
idea of right and to keep the children from the
dangers of the street.  These schools were to be succeeded
by primary schools of two departments, and children
were to enter the schools as they left the infant
school when they were seven years old, and to
continue in them till they were twelve.  The subjects to
be taught were morals, Chinese language, arithmetic,
history, geography, physical science and gymnastics.
At present there was to be no compulsory attendance,
but that was looked forward to as the future ideal.
The schools were to be free, and the money was to
be produced either by taxes or by a raid on some
endowments, notably endowments of religion or of the
theatre&mdash;for theatres in China are endowed.  Funds
were also to be found by subscription, and titles and
ranks were promised to those who shall open schools;
unlike our own country, where, alas, the spending time
on education for the poor is only rewarded by abuse.
These primary schools would lead into higher schools,
and these schools would be the last on the ladder of
education, in which only Chinese subjects were to be
taught.  Above them were to be what they call
middle schools, and the subjects to be taught are
roughly those which are taught in our High Schools:
the Chinese Classics, Chinese language and literature,
foreign languages (one at least to be obligatory),
history, geography, physics, chemistry, science of
government, political economy, drawing, gymnastics;
and after the example of Western schools, singing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
would be also taught.  These schools lead on to the
superior schools in which higher branches of the
same subjects are taught.  These schools were to be
divided into three sections.  The first section consists
of law, literature, and commerce; the second section
of sciences, civil engineering, and agriculture; the
third section of medicine.  It is noteworthy that
English is necessary for those who are learning the
first two sections, while German is compulsory for
those who are learning the third section&mdash;in either
case a third language may be added; and these
superior schools were to lead on to a University,
in which there were to be eight faculties.  The first
faculty is essentially a Chinese one, and I suppose
would be best expressed to our thought by
"belles-lettres," but it includes such things as rites and
poetry; the second faculty is that of law; the third,
history and geography; the fourth, medicine and
pharmacy; the fifth, science; the sixth, agriculture;
the seventh, civil engineering; the eighth, commerce.
</p>

<p>
The University course was to take three years,
and there was to be a University installed in each
province.  The educational system was to be perfected
by two other institutions&mdash;a post-graduate college
where research was to be undertaken, and a normal
college which was to be divided into an inferior and
a superior one for the purpose, the one of preparing
schoolmasters for the village schools, the other for
higher education.  A far less ambitious scheme for
the education of girls has been added to this by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
an edict of 1907.  If my readers have waded through
this scheme I am afraid that they will have come to
the conclusion that China has nothing to learn from
Western powers, but rather she ought to be able to
teach them how to perfect their own incomplete system
of education; but alas, this scheme is only on paper.
In the province where H.E. Yuan-Shih-Kai ruled the
schools approach in some degree to the level of Western
efficiency.  In every other province that I visited or
heard about, the results of this edict were markedly
disappointing; the only exception being where the
Universities had been organised, not in the form or
terms of the edict, but by Western teachers acting
on more or less independent lines.  For instance,
there is a splendid University which has been founded
by Dr. Timothy Richard in Shansi.
</p>

<p>
That University has a curious history.  After the
Boxer massacres compensation was demanded by the
Powers both for the buildings that were destroyed
and for the missionaries that were killed.  A certain
number of the missionary bodies refused absolutely
to take any compensation.  Animated by the spirit
of the early Christian Church, they would not allow
that the blood that had been shed for the sacred
cause could be paid for in money.  At this juncture
there threatened to be rather an impasse.  The
Western Government were insisting on compensation,
and it was doubtful and uncertain how that compensation
should be paid.  The Chinese Government sent
for the Protestant missionary in whom they had the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P275"></a>275}</span>
greatest confidence, Dr. Timothy Richard, and he
made a suggestion which was at once acceptable to
both the Chinese and to the missionary body, that
the money should be devoted to the founding of a
great University; for ignorance is the most common
cause of fanaticism, and the terrible massacres enacted
in China would never have taken place had China
understood, as Chang-Chih-Tung did understand, that
Western science and enlightenment were for the
benefit of China; so this University was founded.
It was founded under peculiar terms.  It is under the
government of China, and yet not completely so.
Dr. Timothy Richard is for a certain number of years
one of its governors, and he has for ten years at least
the control of the Western side of the education.
He is supported by an able staff, and the Rev. W. E. Soothill
is the existing President.  At the end of the
ten years which are just running out, the status of
the University is to be altered, and is, as far as I
understand, to return to the ordinary status of a
Government University.  I need hardly say that this
University has been highly satisfactory in its teaching,
and lately it has sent many of its students to England
to complete their education.  It suffers, however,
from the absence of a proper preparatory course.
One of the difficulties that lie right in the way of
Chang-Chih-Tung's compromise is the difficulty of
finding time for a Western preparatory course, and
that is only equalled by the difficulty of finding
teachers.  Without time and teachers the students
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P276"></a>276}</span>
arrive at the University period of their lives with only
a very elementary knowledge of Western subjects.
This college can hardly be cited as a college of
high governmental efficiency, but should rather be
regarded as an example of the good that a man
like Dr. Timothy Richard can do if he is only
allowed scope.
</p>

<p>
Another Western University under Chinese Government
control is the one at Tientsin, the Pei-Yang
University.  That University has the advantage of
being well supported by efficient Government schools
at Pao-ting-fu.  One interesting detail about the
Pao-ting-fu school&mdash;a fact indeed which in two or three
ways should give us food for thought&mdash;is that it is
controlled by a Christian who is allowed by the
Government, against their own regulations, to carry
on an active propaganda.  He was the man who,
when the missionaries were murdered at Shansi, at
the risk of his life brought down a message from them
written in blood on a piece of stuff.  Perhaps it is not
extraordinary to find that such a man is producing
excellent work.  The Pei-Yang University, however,
falls far short of our ideals of what a University
standard should be.  Still, as far as it goes, it is very
efficient.  It is taught by a very effective body of
professors.  It has 150 students, and teaches law,
mining, and engineering.  The staff is American
with very few exceptions.  One of those exceptions
is Mr. Wang, a Chinese gentleman who received his
education in London.  Very little philosophy is taught,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P277"></a>277}</span>
only three hours a week are given for Chinese learning,
and the students are expected to acquire a sufficient
knowledge of Chinese subjects before they come to
the University.  The American professors, who proved
to be a delightful set of men, allowed that there was
no real scientific training given in this school.  They
gave the same account of their pupils which you will
hear in every Chinese school.  They excelled in
algebra, drawing, and in the most stupendous power
of committing formulæ to memory.  One of the difficulties
of teaching a Chinese class is that they have
so little difficulty in learning by rote that they much
prefer learning the text-books by heart to trying to
understand them.  The Law School in the Pei-Yang
University is taught by a man who has no knowledge
of Chinese law.  This is one of the small mistakes
made by American educators in China, which I think
must be somewhat misleading for China in the future.
To learn nothing but Western law, and to imagine
that that Western law can be applied directly to the
Chinese people, is to make the same mistake that
Macaulay so eloquently condemned in the old East
India Company.  Such a system of teaching can only
make unreasonable revolutionaries.
</p>

<p>
These two examples of teaching institutions carried
on under the Chinese Government by Western
teachers are wholly exceptional, and though
excellent in their way are unimportant, and having
regard to the vast mass of the population of
China are inconsiderable.  What are five or six
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P278"></a>278}</span>
hundred students to a population of four hundred
millions.
</p>

<p>
I must reserve the account of what I saw of the
schools under Chinese management, including the
Peking University, to another chapter.

CHAPTER XXIII
</h3>

<h4>
THE SAME IN PRACTICE
</h4>

<p>
Any one who has read the preceding account of the
intentions of the Chinese Government might be
pardoned if he supposed that after four or five years
those intentions had borne fruit in an efficient system
of public education.  But one who has resided any
time in China would only smile at the suggestion
that there should be an intimate relation between
what the Chinese Government professes to do and
what the Chinese Government does.  A Manchu
Professor whose European education had enabled
him to appreciate rightly the weaknesses of the
Chinese race, said with great candour, "In China
we begin things, but we never finish them."  I had
the privilege of seeing over some twenty Government
schools in China, and the truth of these words was
very obvious.
</p>

<p>
My hospitable host at Nanking, His Excellency
Tuan-Fang, hearing that I took an interest in
education, declared that he would be very glad that I
should see his schools.  I expressed a regret that
my ignorance of the language would impede me in
thoroughly understanding what was being taught.
He most hospitably said that I could myself examine
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P280"></a>280}</span>
the pupils who were studying Western subjects, and
who therefore spoke English or French, and that my
wife should examine the girls' schools; that we should
be accompanied by two interpreters as well as by the
Director of Education, and that he would examine the
schools in any branch of knowledge that I chose.  So
we sallied forth, a very imposing body, and I was asked
to select what schools I should like to visit.  Of course
I selected the higher grade schools in which Western
subjects were taught.  The first school on which we
descended was the Agricultural College.  The teachers
of Western subjects were two Japanese and one
Chinaman.  They were being taught in Chinese, but I had
no difficulty in finding out in the first room we
entered what they were learning, because the illustrations
were well known to me, for they formed part of
a book of elementary botany which I had at one time
studied.  I suggested to Mr. Tsêng, the interpreter,
that the right course would be to ask the Japanese
master to select his best pupils and that then he should
examine them while I should suggest the questions.
It soon became clear that all the Japanese teacher
was doing was to teach them to copy the illustrations
in the book and nothing else.  For the first time we
noticed what we afterwards discovered to be the
invariable rule, that the Japanese are most perfect
draughtsmen, and that every class taught by the
Japanese always learnt to draw perfectly, though they
learnt little else.  The Chinese were rather pleased that
the Japanese teacher cut such a sorry figure.  We then
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P281"></a>281}</span>
went to the next room.  Again there was a Japanese
teacher professing to explain the model of a
steam-engine; again the pupils were obviously ignorant;
again we bowed and they bowed and we left the room.
</p>

<p>
The next room had quite a different atmosphere.
Obviously efficient work was going on.  The men
were learning elementary chemistry.  The teacher
was a Chinaman who had been trained in London and
spoke English perfectly.  He was as straightforward
as he was efficient.  He frankly said that the progress
that his pupils had made was very limited because of
the short time that they had been at work.  We
congratulated him on the efficient way he was managing
his class, and were interested to hear afterwards that
he was a Christian.  More than once we came across
Christian Chinese, and did not know till later that
they were Christians, but were struck by their
efficiency, which sprang doubtless from a high ideal
of work.
</p>

<p>
We left the Agricultural College and then
proceeded to a High School, which is the name that is
given to a first-grade school that precedes the
University, and which at present stands in its place.  We
had in this school much the same experience.  A
Japanese teacher was teaching biology and was
dissecting a river mussel.  This was done in such a
position that only two men could see what was going
on.  I wondered at this.  Then we found out that he
could not speak a word of Chinese.  He dissected the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P282"></a>282}</span>
mussel and professed to give a lecture on its anatomy
to a pupil who understood Japanese, and then the
pupil delivered the lecture to the rest of the class.
My Chinese interpreters were of opinion that very
little could filter through the class in this way, but
the Director of Education smiled sweetly.  He
obviously felt that in some mysterious way Western
education was percolating to the pupils under his
charge.  As we returned along the corridor I glanced
in.  The biological lecture was over; I expect it was
the only one of the session, and the pupils went away
with admirable pictures of the river mussel.  If the
Japanese teachers only set up for teachers of drawing,
I am certain they would have no equals in the world.  A
little further on in the same building there was a
professed teacher of drawing.  The class was not a selected
class, they were drawing from a cast of a well-known
Greek statue, and the work was simply admirable.  I
am confident that, except in an art school, you would
not find better work in Europe.  In the next room there
was a science teacher.  To impress the Director of
Education, he rashly set a machine for demonstrating
the vibration of sound at work.  The machine would
not demonstrate anything, much to the joy of my
Chinese friends, solely for the reason that he had
not wound it up.
</p>

<p>
I should tire my readers if I were to go on
describing room after room.  I cannot of course be
certain how far these Japanese teachers had taught
science, but at any rate their pupils had not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P283"></a>283}</span>
acquired any knowledge, and I think we may easily
be too hard on the Japanese.  One must remember
that they have to supply teachers for all their own
schools.  Is it likely that they will be either able or
willing to send into other countries efficient teachers
of Western education?  It is not as if Western
knowledge had been for long taught in Japan.  Their
schools are now many and they were few.  I suppose
no man, no great number of men at any rate, over
thirty-five or forty, are equipped with an efficient
Western education in Japan.  One wonders why
they allow their national reputation to be injured by
supposing it to be possible for them to supply these
teachers of Western knowledge.  Political motive
suggests itself as a reason why a country so proud
and so ambitious as Japan should allow a course
that must eventually injure her reputation as an
enlightened power.
</p>

<p>
The next school we went over was very interesting.
It was what is called a Law School.  The men
who are learning in this school will be the future
officials of China; only, following the Chinese custom,
they will rarely or never hold office in the province
in which they were born and educated.  They were
men of some standing, and it looked strange to see
all these senior men, over sixty in number, sitting
like children at the school desks.  They were dressed,
in uniform, and were under a sort of military
discipline.  The senior pupil gave the word of command,
and at once the class sprang to attention and saluted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P284"></a>284}</span>
us, while we bowed first to the teacher, then to
the class, after which the examination began.  They
were chiefly taught by Chinese, and, as one might
expect, were well taught in the Chinese Classics.
We were informed that the Japanese teacher was
teaching them Western law; but in answer to an
inquiry he explained that he had not yet taught
them any law, but that he was teaching them the
Japanese language, since it was through the Japanese
language alone a knowledge of Western law could
be attained.  The reason seemed very inconclusive
especially when one remembers that the Japanese
know and write Chinese characters, so that it is easy to
get any work that is printed in Japan printed in the
character which every Chinaman can read.  I have
before explained the peculiar merit of the Chinese
character is that people who speak different
dialects and even languages can read it equally well.
I pointed all this out to my Chinese friends.  I think
their suspicions too were aroused.  Certainly this
experience lends colour to the suggestion that Japan
hopes that the Manchu dynasty will be succeeded,
not by a Chinese dynasty, but by a dynasty from
a race whose courage, energy, and intellect has
already humiliated Russia and China, and may not
inconceivably dominate China, should, for instance,
Germany and England go to war.
</p>

<p>
We then went to see some classes taught by
Americans.  Two things struck me in those classes.
First, for some reason I cannot understand, unless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P285"></a>285}</span>
there was jealousy at work, the class was small
compared with the enormous classes which I had seen
elsewhere&mdash;thirty, twenty, or even fifteen were the
numbers that white men were teaching.  The other
thing which struck me was that the selection of
subjects might be improved.  For instance, one of the
teachers was teaching Anson's Law of Contract;
one could scarcely see how a knowledge of the
English law of contract could be very beneficial to
a resident in China; and on looking over the book
that another class was using, I found that they were
being instructed how to buy an advowson in England.
I cannot of course say that the class was actually
taught this interesting information, but it was
certainly in their text-book.  Another text-book was a
summary of the history of the world; it was issued
by an American firm.  On looking up the chapter
which referred to China I found the most extreme
expression that an American democratic feeling could
prompt used with regard to the Emperor of China.
I pointed this out to the Chinamen.  Apparently
no one had taken the trouble to glance through the
books that were being used.  Such action is regrettable,
because it inevitably brings Western education
into disrepute, and suggests it to be something
essentially revolutionary.
</p>

<p>
Another curious experience was to find a
Cantonese Chinaman teaching a science class in English
because he did not know Mandarin.  It will be one
of the limitations to the usefulness of the Hong-Kong
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P286"></a>286}</span>
University that the bulk of the students who attend
it will be Cantonese-speaking Chinamen, and they
will therefore be inefficient as teachers to the great
mass of the Chinese empire.  A University which
hopes to produce teachers which shall teach the
whole of China must be a University situated in
Mandarin-speaking China.
</p>

<p>
It was waxing late after we had seen these
schools.  We had consumed a great amount of the
day in partaking of a most excellent Chinese
luncheon, where the only mistake I had made&mdash;at
least the only one of which I was conscious&mdash;was
in not being instructed in the nature of the
entertainment.  I had yielded to the solicitations of my
host and had partaken largely of the first two or
three courses.  Later on in the luncheon I was
divided between the desire to be polite and a fear
that the capacity of the human body might be
exceeded.  Our host was the Director of Education,
and my interpreter whispered to me that he had
a great knowledge of cooking and that "he loved
a dry joke."  His skill as a Director of Education,
especially of Western subjects, might be doubted;
but as a kindly host and an amusing companion he
would have few equals in our country.  This aspect
of the Chinese official too often escapes the
Western critic; whether efficient or inefficient, they are
always agreeable men.  After luncheon he begged
to be excused, as he had a visit of ceremony to
pay; it was the birthday of a dear friend's mother.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P287"></a>287}</span>
His official robes were brought out, and clothed in
them he took his seat in a sedan chair and left us.
</p>

<p>
We were taken on, rather unwillingly I fancied, to
see the Commercial School.  The hour of the classes
was over, but still the school was really instructive.
What was so remarkable about it was the extreme
simplicity of the place where the boys lodged.  The
school is not maintained by Government, but by the
rich Silk Guild of Nanking.  Many members of this
Silk Guild, I was assured, would only be able to read
and write enough to carry on their business.  They
are a rich and powerful body, and this school is
intended for their sons.  The dormitory was a
slate-covered building without any ceiling, and the beds
were arranged like berths on board ship, one on the
top of the other, with narrow passages between them.
In this way, of course, a room was made to hold a
perfectly surprising number of individuals.  I could
not help remembering the Church Army Lodging-house
at home.  If we arranged the beds as they
were arranged in that room, though we should double
or treble the number of travellers we could house, we
should incur the wrath of the sanitary authority.
</p>

<p>
Very different was the Naval School.  Here
reigned efficiency, for the Naval School is under the
partial control of two officers lent by His Majesty's
Navy.  The limit of their control was the limit of
their efficiency.  For instance, the Chinese Government
sometimes refused to let their naval officers be
shown an actual ship; their idea was much the same
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P288"></a>288}</span>
as that of the lady who forbid her son to bathe until
he had learnt to swim.  The difficulty was very great
for anything like practical instruction.  Continual
representations induced the Chinese Government to
allow the boys to have a trip on the river in an old
ship.  The moment this was accomplished there was
great self-congratulation on the part of the Chinese
official; from resisting this reasonable suggestion they
changed to self-laudation at the wisdom of accepting
the plan.  The efficiency of the teaching was not
only hindered by the want of practical knowledge,
which is of course fatal to naval efficiency, but these
officers had also to complain of what so many other
Europeans have to complain&mdash;first, that the people
whom they were sent to teach did not know enough
English, so that much of their time was spent in
teaching elementary English; secondly, that their
classes were not large enough.  Far away the most
effective way of using a Western teacher would be
to use them as we saw them used in one school.  The
Western teacher was supported by two or three
Chinese assistants; he gave his lecture in English,
and the pupils took notes; then the assistants went
round the desks, looked at the notes, and explained
in Chinese all those points that the pupils had not
fully taken in.  This plan has another advantage,
that it trains these Chinese teachers to continue the
work of a Western teacher, and in some ways it is a
more efficient system than the normal schools.  The
Western teacher of course exercises a general
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P289"></a>289}</span>
supervision over his class and maintains order and
discipline.
</p>

<p>
While I had been busy with the boys' schools, my
wife had been busy with the girls' schools.  She was
taken over the Viceroy's School, the one already
described where the little girls showed such surprising
knowledge of the Chinese Classics.  Her experience
was less happy than mine.  The children were being
drilled by a Japanese instructress who could hardly
play at all; she used a small gem harmonium, and
the drilling was little better than a feeble country
dance.  The same instructress was responsible for a
singing lesson; she played with one hand on a
harmonium, and allowed the children to bawl as they
pleased without either time or tune.  All the pupils
at this school were day scholars.
</p>

<p>
The interpreter who conducted Mrs. King, the
Consul's wife, and my wife over this and the
following schools had removed his own daughter to a
mission school, thinking she would receive better
teaching.  As regards the musical part of the
instruction there can be no question but that he was right.
The next school she saw was also for the children of
the gentry, who supported it by subscriptions.  There
were 140 girls, fifty of whom were boarders whose
parents paid for their board.  These fifty young ladies
all slept in one room, and their toilet arrangements
impressed my wife as anything but luxurious; the
effect was more like a steerage cabin on a big liner
than an ordinary school dormitory.  The class-rooms
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P290"></a>290}</span>
were all on the ground floor, leading from courtyard
to courtyard in Chinese house fashion.  The instruction
seemed to be mainly Chinese, with attention paid
to geography, drawing, and fancy work, English being
taught by a young Chinese teacher in a rather
elementary way.  The mistresses appeared in dignified
skirts, no doubt as a symbol of authority.
</p>

<p>
The last school she was shown was larger and less
exclusive.  It was well organised, the classes being
arranged with sense and discrimination.  There were
200 pupils of all ages and ranks, the school being a
public one.  They were mostly dressed in black.  Ten
lady teachers presided over this school, including a
normal class with a male superintendent; the whole
in Chinese buildings.  The teaching comprised
Confucian ethics, the Chinese characters, arithmetic,
geography, drawing from flat copies, and English
given by a young Chinese girl who had been educated
in a Shanghai mission school.
</p>

<p>
The instruction seemed to be good on the whole.
About one-fourth of the scholars boarded at the
school.  Attached to it was a kindergarten managed
rather sleepily by two Japanese.  Again the children's
singing was hardly worthy of the name.  My wife
was impressed by the inferiority of the Government
girls' schools to the mission girls' schools in almost
every particular.  Doubtless they will soon improve,
but at present the Government does not seem able
to obtain efficient teachers, and is much too inclined
to spend vast sums on practically useless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P291"></a>291}</span>
apparatus&mdash;useless because the instructors do not understand
how to use it.
</p>

<p>
Our experiences at Nanking were extremely
interesting, but they were not exceptional.  We saw over
Government schools at Wuchang, again at Changsha,
and also we saw something of the Peking University.
At Changsha matters were not nearly so far advanced
as they were at Nanking.  There were the same
Japanese teachers, one of whom taught English, but
I could not get a single copy-book produced to show
how far they had advanced in the knowledge of this
language.  There were the same American teachers;
good men, but unable to do much owing to their want
of knowledge of Chinese, and owing, as I said before,
to a certain jealousy which prevented them having a
sufficient number of pupils.  The very excellent school
which is carried on at Shanghai, under Western
management, forms a good contrast to the others.
This school does not profess to teach very advanced
subjects, but it teaches ordinary English subjects most
efficiently.  The system is this: the boys are first
taught in Chinese, while they are acquiring the
rudiments of Western knowledge and of the English
language; they are then transferred to a class which
is taught in English by Chinese; here they acquire
from their own countrymen a very thorough knowledge
of English and a tolerable knowledge of Western
subjects.  In both these divisions of the school all
explanations are given in Chinese.  After they have
acquired a good knowledge of English they are then
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P292"></a>292}</span>
advanced to the class which is taught by an
Englishman, who has some knowledge of Chinese; here they
perfect their knowledge of English, and the teacher
can if necessary explain a difficulty by the help of
a Chinese word.  Lastly, they are taught absolutely
in English by an Englishman who need not know
any Chinese, as it is never used.
</p>

<p>
At Wuchang the schools were similar to those of
Nanking.  The only school which was exceptionally
interesting was the School of Languages.  This was
managed by a Manchu, who was prompt, exact, and
efficient&mdash;in fact, the very greatest contrast to the
usual Chinese official.  He spoke French perfectly, as
he had been brought up in Paris and spent some time
in the West.  In a few words he showed that he
understood the problem of education in China.  He
told me that his nation would never succeed in
teaching their nationals Western subjects until they
selected teachers who had some experience in the
knowledge and in the art of teaching, and that the
habit of regarding all Westerners as capable of
teaching all Western subjects must produce disaster.  He
boldly professed himself a Roman Catholic, and
was one of several examples that came under my
notice of the wonderful influence that Christianity
has on the formation of a vigorous character.  The
boys had been very well taught in English and
French, and I gathered in German and Russian as
well.  Certainly if China gets such men to lead her,
she need have little fear of the power of the West.

CHAPTER XXIV
</h3>

<h4>
DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF EDUCATION
</h4>

<p>
The difficulties in the way of education differ in
Government schools and in Mission schools.  If the
Chinese Government could unite the Government
schools to the Mission schools, they would overcome
all these difficulties, and they would have a most
perfect system of Western education.  Of all the
difficulties lying in the way of Government schools, first
and foremost is the fundamental weakness of China,
that weakness which is endangering her national
existence, a weakness which I fear she will never
completely surmount until she accepts a higher ideal.
For her weakness is the universal greed for gain.
Resident after resident reported the same cause of
weakness, that a Chinaman cannot resist taking his
"squeeze"&mdash;that is, his commission.  It is not of
course so dishonest as it would be on our side of the
globe, because a Chinaman is more or less avowedly
paid by these commissions, and therefore in many
ways they are rather equivalent to the fees paid by
an Englishman to a Government office than to illicit
commissions, the acceptance of which in this country
is punishable by law.  If it is not as immoral, it is
almost as deleterious to efficiency, because it tends
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P294"></a>294}</span>
to make officials unreasonable in their action.  To
ask the reason why things are done in China, is
always to receive the answer that somebody got a
"squeeze" thereby.
</p>

<p>
And so it is with education.  As we wandered
through room after room filled with apparatus
sufficient to teach thousands of students, and of such a
complicated nature as absolutely to confuse those
students when taught, one longed that a tithe of this
expenditure could have been used for that modicum
of apparatus which is necessary to make not a few
mission schools thoroughly efficient.  Much of the
apparatus has never got outside its packing cases,
and perhaps a great deal had better permanently
remain there, for nothing is so subversive to the
proper teaching of men whose great defect is that
they have never handled things with their hands, as
to give them complicated apparatus to demonstrate
the most recondite laws of science.  A great scientific
teacher, when consulted about the apparatus necessary
for elementary science, advised plenty of bonnet
wire, glass tubes, and one or two other little things
of that sort.  When one asks why the Chinese have
been so lavish in their expenditure on apparatus
which they cannot and will not use, the reply is
the same old answer&mdash;somebody got a commission.
Bui I think beyond that there is a real belief that
education is a matter of expensive apparatus&mdash;a
belief which is not altogether unknown on this side
of the globe.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P295"></a>295}</span>
</p>

<p>
This brings me to the second great difficulty in
the path of Government education.  They will believe
that an efficient education results rather from having
an expensive building than from a competent teacher.
I have before had occasion to refer to the extreme
simplicity of the life of the Chinese.  Many of the
schools were housed, and very comfortably housed, in
Chinese houses.  The Chinese house always looks
out on a courtyard, and courtyard is joined to
courtyard by passages.  The rooms are only divided
from the courtyard by carved wooden screens whose
interstices are sometimes filled with paper and
sometimes not.  They are eminently sanitary&mdash;in fact, to
a large extent they fulfil the requirements of the
"open-air cure."  In one case in the courtyard were
a lot of basins and ewers, and the boys were
compelled to have a wash, which if extensive must, in the
winter, have been extremely unpleasant.  For all this
I expressed my sincere admiration to my friend the
Director of Education, but he received my
compliment much in the same spirit with which a mother
accepts your assertion that her child is far prettier
in her every-day dress with tousled hair than she is
in her Sunday clothes, as with hideous tidiness and
pharisaic pomp she wends her way to church.  My
compliment was taken almost as an insult.  I was
then shown the ideal of China, a huge and hideous
building, modelled on the architecture which white
men deem necessary to enable them to support the
tropical heat, to the fatal effects of which they are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P296"></a>296}</span>
so sensitive; massive walls to carry the heavy roof;
huge arched verandahs where white people may get
the breath of air they so need.  Of what use are all
these to a race who cannot understand what you
mean when you speak of the heat being unhealthy,
who, however sensitive to cold and wet, flourish in
the warmth to which they have been accustomed all
their lives?  The Chinese do not admire this
architecture for its æsthetic effect; they care little about
its heat-resisting qualities.  They like it because it
is Western; because Western people are educated
in such buildings; because, I suppose, they expect
Western learning to work in some way through those
massive stone walls to the minds of the pupils; and
because they fancy Western ideas would be more
easily understood in these hideous surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, there is no serious effort made to get good
teachers.  At one time, I understand, they had in
their service a very remarkable body of men&mdash;men
like Professor Martin of Peking&mdash;whose knowledge
was only equalled by the sincerity of their purpose.
Lately they have been getting rid of these men as
fast as they could, the cry of "China for the Chinese"
being perhaps responsible for this movement; and
they have endeavoured to replace them by Chinese
subjects with but little success.  They have therefore
fallen back again on foreigners, largely on Japanese.
These men are some of them very able and qualified
teachers; some, on the other hand, have had little or
no experience of teaching, and their inefficiency tends
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P297"></a>297}</span>
to bring all foreign teachers into disrepute.  Not only
must the teacher have a special knowledge of the
art of teaching, but a teacher of a race like the
Chinese, with different traditions to our own, must
well understand those traditions.  We can best
realise the enormous difficulty a Chinese student has
of learning from a Western teacher by remembering
how impossible it is for any of us to understand
something that is put from a Chinese point of view.
</p>

<p>
If the Chinese Government want efficient foreign
teachers, they must not pick up anybody, but they
must hold out inducements to young men to come
as teachers, and must give them security of tenure.
If, for instance, the Chinese Government had in their
service such an efficient body of men as could be
found in the mission schools, they would have no
difficulty.  Another difficulty which stands in the
way of the Chinese schools is their want of discipline.
One of the most remarkable developments in China is
the school strike.  They have undoubtedly
extraordinary powers of united action, but the school
strike originates as much in the weakness of the
teachers as it does in the remarkable power the
Chinese race has of united action; you hear of it all
over China, and it is sometimes ludicrous, sometimes
serious.  One school struck because the foreign
teachers required the pupils to pass an examination
of efficiency before they would give them a
testimonial.  This was deemed most incorrect by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P298"></a>298}</span>
scholars, who held a doctrine which would be very
attractive to our own undergraduates, that residence
alone was a sufficient qualification for a degree.  Many
of the strikes take place for most occult reasons.
</p>

<p>
And this brings me to mission schools, for strikes
take place equally with them as in Government
schools.  They occur in boys' and in girls' schools,
and for the most un-understandable reasons.  In one
school the strike began because a Chinese teacher
caught hold of a boy's queue and dragged him by it.
The boy's "face" was injured, and his companions
made common cause.  Another strike took place in
a girls' school because a girl was punished.  Of course
these strikes do not occur where there is an efficient
and vigorous teacher.  It was attempted, for instance,
with Archdeacon Moule, but it only ended in the
leaders being caned.  Still, one mission had its
school practically ruined by one of these strikes; it
was the result of an intrigue by an unbelieving teacher
who had been employed by mistake.  These strikes
are not a very great difficulty to the mission when it
is in charge of efficient and experienced men; a little
justice and firmness apparently soon disposes of any
unreasonable resistance to authority, and tact and
knowledge prevent any friction which may result
from regulations that may be offensive to Chinese ideas.
</p>

<p>
A far greater difficulty in the mission schools is the
question of finance.  The Chinese for the most part
pay their scholars; the result is that the mission school
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P299"></a>299}</span>
has to compete not only against a free school, but
against a school in which pupils are paid to come,
and it appears as if it would be almost an impossibility
for mission schools to support themselves against such
competition.  As a matter of fact it is usually found
that so great a value do the Chinese put on the
efficient education that they receive in the mission
school that they are willing to pay a reasonable fee
rather than be paid for the useless education given
by the Government school.  Still it makes finance a
certain difficulty.  Many of the schools are largely
self-supporting; others rely on fees to find board
and lodgings for the pupils and the salaries of the
native teachers.  So that every school more or less
carries a great financial burden.
</p>

<p>
The great difficulty of mission schools at the
present time springs partially from Government
action.  The ideal of every Chinaman is at present
to be in the service of the Government; we
must emphasise that word "at present," because
undoubtedly, owing to the railway development of
China, a wealthy commercial class must arise all over
her land, as it has already risen in the great port
towns.  This class will be independent of Government
and will be the class that needs Western education
more than any other class, for they will be in
intimate contact with the West.  But at present those
who seek a higher education hope for the most part
for Government employment.  One of the rules of
Government employment is that the officials shall on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P300"></a>300}</span>
certain days repair to the various temples to
represent the Emperor, and it is naturally held that
such action is impossible for a Christian.  Besides
this, the Government makes it extremely hard if not
impossible for a Christian to go to its University at
Peking.  All teachers and pupils in a Government
school are required on the Emperor's birthday to bow
down or kow-tow to the tablet of Confucius.
Missionaries hold that such action is not consistent with
the Christian faith, and therefore the mission school
is very loath to send its Christian pupils on to the
Government University.
</p>

<p>
It must, however, be stated that several Chinese
scholars, including a Christian, have indignantly
denied that the kow-towing to the tablet of
Confucius implies anything more than the respect due
to the greatest thinker that China ever possessed.
We had the privilege of being shown over Peking
University by an extremely able and pleasant
Chinese gentleman, a Christian.  He showed us the
tablet of Confucius and explained to us the ceremony.
It must be owned that externally there was but
little that one could associate with the idea of
divinity.  The tablet was behind a glass case, and at
first it suggested some sort of educational apparatus.
The desks were placed at right angles to it, so that
it did not actually occupy what could be regarded
as the chief place in the room.  The gentleman who
showed us over strenuously denied that any of the
pupils in Peking Government University could regard
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P301"></a>301}</span>
Confucius as God.  None were admitted to the
University except those who were already well
versed in the Chinese Classics, and they knew
perfectly well that in these Classics Confucius said that
he had no supernatural power; while the leading
commentator on Confucius, the man whose teaching
had more than any other influenced modern
Confucianism, was avowedly an agnostic, and therefore,
so far from regarding the tablet as divine, it would
be nearer the truth to say that the greater bulk
of the scholars disbelieve in the idea of God
altogether, or at any rate hold an agnostic position
with regard to it.  When I put these difficulties
to an eminent missionary the answer was, yes, but
by a late edict they have made Confucius equal to
heaven and earth, and so whatever doubts there
were before have been resolved, and the Chinese
Government has decreed to Confucius divine honour.
I put this criticism to an able civil servant in the
employ of the Chinese Government, and he answered
that that decree was really intended to have the
opposite effect.  The Chinese are aware that they
are as a matter of fact relegating Confucius to
a secondary place in education, and they are
therefore most anxious to propitiate the Confucian scholars.
They have compromised the matter much on the
same system that we use in the West with regard
to some politician whose services have been valuable,
but who is actually a hindrance in the House of
Commons.  Confucius has been given divine honours
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P302"></a>302}</span>
as the worn-out politician in England is given a
peerage; it is a form of honourable retirement.  A very
intellectual Chinese, however, expressed himself quite
otherwise, saying that anybody who understood
Chinese views would have grasped the meaning of
making Confucius equal to heaven and earth.  As
heaven and earth induce the wealth of mankind, so
has Confucius done by his teaching; as heaven and
earth can change things and make things exist that
were not, so with Confucius; but that Chinese
theology regards heaven and earth as created by
the one God, and therefore Confucius is put in the
position of an exalted but a created being.  What
impresses perhaps the Westerner more than this
rather recondite Chinese reasoning is the simple
fact that while by the Government edict it is decreed
that the tablet of Confucius shall be honoured by
three bowings and nine knockings, it is also
ordained that the schoolmaster shall be honoured by
one bowing or kow-tow and three times knocking
the ground with the head.  The similarity of the
salute to the schoolmaster and to the tablet of
Confucius rather disposes of the idea that the act
of reverence to the tablet involves worship.  On the
other hand, it is pointed out that this is the main
ceremony that is observed in what are called the
temples of Confucius; but when this was put to
a Chinaman, his answer was that they were not
temples, and if there had been any worship in
those temples, they would have been frequented
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P303"></a>303}</span>
as much by the women and children as by the
men, but as a matter of fact they were frequented
only by literati.  When it was suggested that
on occasion, however, there were sacrifices in these
temples, he did not deny this, but changed the
subject.
</p>

<p>
But we must not say that the respect and
reverence offered to Confucius, whether it involves
idolatry or not, is the only reason why Christian
pupils are advised not to go to the Government
Universities.  There are two other great reasons.
The first is an extremely practical one: the education
in Government Universities is avowedly imperfect.
The fact that the Government have subscribed to the
English University at Hong-Kong and to the German
College in Shantung show that they are aware of
their own shortcomings.  The second reason is that the
racial characteristics of Chinamen demand that they
should act as a body.  An acute observer asserted
that, as far as he was able to judge the matter, no
Chinaman ever acted independently; and that
therefore it is putting a burden greater than the race
can bear to ask that Christians should maintain their
Christianity when they are surrounded by an
unbelieving and heathen atmosphere; and that, as a
matter of fact, the result of sending students to
Government Universities would, except in cases of
men of very strong character, be to send them to
unbelief.  Yet a greater and simpler objection is
that these Government Universities for the most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P304"></a>304}</span>
part do not exist, and that it is impossible for small
institutions like that at Peking to take even a
hundredth part of the students who are clamouring for
Western education.  But the mission schools have
another and a newer difficulty, one which is causing
the greatest heart-searching.  This I must reserve
for the next chapter.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
</h3>

<h4>
THE NEED OF A UNIVERSITY EXPLAINED
</h4>

<p>
The great danger that threatens mission schools, a
danger which is increasing every year, is that the
best pupils of these schools have to go to Universities
in search of Western knowledge where they are
exposed to the insidious attacks of Western materialism.
</p>

<p>
The teachers have at present no alternative; they
have to send the best and brightest of their pupils
somewhere to complete their education.  It would be
unfair on a boy to refuse to send him on, and if he is
to receive a higher education, where can he get it but
at some place where the atmosphere is distinctly
anti-Christian.
</p>

<p>
There is in the East no place with a neutral
atmosphere as there is in the West.  In the West
most people have had some Christian training, or
at least they comprehend Christian ethics.  So in a
Western institution, even if the education be wholly
secular, a Christian does not find everything
antipathetic to his faith.  But in the East the vast
majority are non-Christian, and consequently the
moral and intellectual atmosphere is hostile and
antipathetic to a Christian.  Here if an institution
is non-religious it is probably not hostile to religion.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P306"></a>306}</span>
In the East if an institution is non-religious it is
probably anti-Christian.  At present the only
University in action is that of Tokio, though we are
promised others, and its ill effects have been so
obvious that the Chinese Government have ordered
a wholesale withdrawal of pupils from its unhealthy
influence.
</p>

<p>
As we have already pointed out, Western civilisation
is magnificent but it is destructive, and when
taught without any constructive religious teaching it
inevitably tends to destroy all spiritual ideas and too
often also to pervert the moral ideals of the race.  As
the pupil goes through the mission school he learns
within its walls to shake himself free from the
haunting fear of demons which besets every Chinaman; he
has slowly realised that God is holy, good and loving,
and has either accepted Christianity or stands on the
threshold of the formal acceptance; he has reached
the end of the curriculum of the school or college and
his brilliancy demands a higher education.  Attracted
by the reputation of Tokio, he goes to its University,
and there he finds himself in an atmosphere where all
the destructive thought of Europe grows rankly; the
good God in whom he has learned to believe in the
mission school follows in the track of the demons of
his youth, and he is left believing in a world founded
by blind chance, where ethics are things of service to
restrain your neighbour but folly to follow yourself.
"Eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," is the lesson
which is not perhaps taught in so many words, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P307"></a>307}</span>
which none the less is forced into his mind; his views
become those of Falstaff; all that is fine, all that is
noble, flees from his life; though he no longer believes
in the God of Love, he does not return to the belief
in the demons of his youth; there is nothing in his
world beyond getting rich or gratifying the flesh and
laughing at those people who believe in higher ideals.
He has been acquainted with and has learnt to loathe
from his youth up the philosophy of Yang Choo.  He
has, for instance, despised such a sentence as this:
"The people of high antiquity knew both the
shortness of life and how suddenly and completely it might
be closed by death, and therefore they obeyed every
suggestion of the movements of their hearts, refusing
not what was natural for them to like, nor seeking to
avoid any pleasure that occurred to them, they paid
no heed to the incitement of fame; they enjoyed
themselves according to their nature; they did not
resist the common tendency of all things to
self-enjoyment; they cared not to be famous after death.
They managed to keep clear of punishment; as to
fame and praise, being first or last, long life or short
life, these things did not come into their
calculations."  And now he finds that the philosophy of
Yang Choo is as he supposes the newest thought of
the great rich successful Western world; as he
returns to his home and spreads abroad the poisonous
doctrines that he has imbibed, the missionary wonders
whether, after all, it would not have been better to
have left the man to his primitive demonology.

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P308"></a>308}</span>
</p>

<p>
The American mission bodies saw this danger from
the first, and have already set up great educational
establishments which to a certain extent supply this
need.  That great institution Bishop Graves' College
at Jessfield, the Boone College at Wuchang, the
British College at Weihsien, and Methodist
Universities at Soochow and Peking, are all examples of
good work.  But they do not, any of them, bring
the student up to what we call University standard,
or what I understand is called in America the
post-graduate course; what is felt is, that there is need of
an institution in which the highest knowledge shall
be taught, where the true aspect of Western thought
shall be shown&mdash;not that aspect which is bringing
France to destruction, not that aspect which makes
Belgium unconcerned at the Congo scandals, but the
aspect which both in America and in England we
have always admired at least in theory, and in
practice when we have been strong.  The fundamental
truth on which our civilisation rests is that
God is good, and that therefore truth and progress
are right and possible, and that the highest expression
of the goodness of God is in His incarnation as it is
universally taught by Christians of various views
and of many denominations.  The West owes to the
East, if there is any common duty of man to man, to
set before it the real truth as to the greatness of
Western civilisation, namely, that it is the result of
Christianity.
</p>

<p>
But missions are not anxious merely for a University
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P309"></a>309}</span>
as a means of defence against the materialistic
onslaught which threatens their work&mdash;they need it
for many other reasons; for instance, the University
would make it possible for all denominations to have
highly educated native ministers.  No student of
missions can ever be content to regard them as an
ideal arrangement.  The conception of a race being
ministered to spiritually by another race is obviously
inadequate; it is open to many criticisms; there must
be a confusion in the mind of the convert between
what is national and what is Christian; one Chinese
regarded Christianity with doubt because he had
heard that the German Emperor is a Christian,
and to his mind he is the embodiment of the fierce
piratical Western races.  The word which the Chinese
use for robbers means red-bearded men, so associated,
alas, is the Western race in China with war and
rapine; it is easy for a member of the Western
races to be misunderstood when he is talking about
the religion of love.  Would any English parish like
as its Rector a Chinaman, even if he were saintly
and went so far as to cut off his queue?
</p>

<p>
Setting aside the associations of the Western race,
the Western race has great difficulty in speaking
Chinese without making ridiculous mistakes.  Who
among us has not smiled when the Chinaman's
inability to say the letter "r" has caused him to
offer us "lice" to eat, but what must it be to the
Chinaman when he hears the Western preacher lost
amidst those mysterious Chinese intonations, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P310"></a>310}</span>
therefore making some wonderful statement.  A
Chinese gentleman assured me that he had listened
to a missionary extolling the virtues of a wild pig.
Reverence forbids explaining what was really meant.
If the ministers of religion are to be Chinese, it is
obvious that they must be highly educated Chinese;
to have religion taught by ignorant men in a country
like China where learning is reverenced so profoundly,
must be to condemn it as the religion of the coolie.
The Chinese minister must be able to maintain his
position, not only against the Confucian scholar, but
against the Western materialist, and must therefore
have an equally good education.  Without saying
that it is reasonable to expect that the Western
missionary should be withdrawn within the next
few years, I think it is wisdom for every mission
body to aim at founding a body of educated native
clergy who can free Christianity from the taunt of
being a foreign religion, and who can, when the
foreigner leaves China, take his place and uphold
the faith.
</p>

<p>
If to have an educated native ministry is one
great object of the University, another great and
only less important object is the creation of an
intellectual Christian laity who shall form and
direct Christian public opinion.  The school teacher,
the writer, are only one degree less important, if
indeed they are so, than the Christian minister;
and if as China assimilates Western civilisation,
she finds in her midst a body of men conversant
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P311"></a>311}</span>
with the best side of that civilisation, able to
interpret its mysteries to her, so that it does not
become subversive to all spiritual religion and
morality, it is more than probable that she will
take those men and put them in high positions,
and the grain of mustard seed will by their means
grow into a plant which shall overshadow the whole
of China.  The other day I was reading how
St. Grimaldi and St. Neots founded the University of
Oxford in 886.  Theology, grammar and rhetoric,
music and arithmetic, geometry and astronomy,
were the subjects taught.  After a thousand years
we are in a position to judge of the success of the
experiment.  Surely every one will wish to have a
hand in founding a similar undertaking.
</p>

<p>
The foundation of this University cannot for two
or three reasons be left to one body.  In the first
place, no one communion will be rich enough to
undertake such a work; secondly, it might cause
a certain narrowness of atmosphere; thirdly and
chiefly, co-operation among Christians would afford
an object-lesson to the Chinese of the real unity
there is between them.  We are constantly twitted
with the fact that we confuse the heathen by
professing the religion of love and then setting before
them a mass of warring sects.  If we can unite in
the founding of such a University, we shall show
that though we see the Christian truth in different
aspects we have agreed that truth is one, and have
in spite of our divisions a fundamental unity.  When
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P312"></a>312}</span>
this matter was referred to at the Shanghai
Conference, considerable difficulty was felt among
missionaries as to the terms on which such a
University should be founded.  It was agreed to refer
it to the Committee on Education, and that
Committee of Education has in the year 1909 welcomed
the formation of such a University.  Dr. Hawks
Pott, who of all men in China can best speak as
an authority on education, since he has organised
and maintained that wonderful institution at
Jessfield, warmly advocated its formation.
</p>

<p>
No doubt one of the reasons why the missionaries
now see their way to the acceptance of this University
is because a neutral body has come forward to initiate
the undertaking.  Committees of the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge have been sitting for many
months considering the question with all the skill
and ability which their great learning and technical
knowledge enable them to bring to bear on this
subject.  Though of course they have a thorough
knowledge of education in all its aspects, they were
aware that they lacked knowledge of China and the
Chinese, so for many months they heard and examined
the evidence of any one who was thoroughly acquainted
with China and with the conditions of missionary
work.  They devised a scheme which they thought
would at once satisfy the workers in the mission field
and be acceptable to the Chinese.  The mere outline
of the scheme is that this University should encourage
the formation of denominational hostels, which shall
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P313"></a>313}</span>
be under the control of individual missionary bodies,
and which shall form colleges at the University;
and while the University alone would concern itself
with giving secular teaching from a neutral
standpoint, the colleges would give Christian teaching to
their pupils.  In this way all conflict between missions
would be avoided; each mission would continue to
care for the pupils which it had hitherto sheltered
and educated.  To the University would accrue the
great gain of having a supply of properly prepared
pupils coming into it from the mission schools, one
of the causes of disappointment of ill-considered
University schemes being that there is no proper provision
for a supply of pupils.  In the West there are
numerous secondary schools, and any University can
easily find a sufficient number of pupils properly
grounded in knowledge.  In the East to erect a
University without feeding schools is like building
a house in the Chinese fashion roof first.  The Yale
University Mission found itself compelled to set up
elementary schools to teach the elementary Western
knowledge which was necessary before even the lowest
grade of college work could be attempted.  Western
teachers are, as we have before explained, few and
far between outside the mission schools, and therefore
mission schools would both help and be helped by
a University.  The University completes the work
they have begun, and returns the men to the mission
to carry on its work with honour and efficiency.
On the other hand, the mission supplies the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P314"></a>314}</span>
University with pupils, which after all are the prime
necessity of education.
</p>

<p>
Another great feature of the Oxford and
Cambridge scheme was that the University should aim
to be a native University, and this no doubt was the
side which attracted the Chinese.  Instead of using
knowledge, the common heritage of all men, as the
means of imposing the domination of the alien on
China, knowledge is offered by this University as
essentially the thing which belongs to China as well
as to any other race.  If in the commencement the
majority of the professors must belong to the Western
race, it is to be hoped that many of its professors
will soon come from China, and that when the
University is well begun, and Christianity has become
as national a religion as it is in our land, and
Western civilisation has lost the right to describe
itself by that epithet, and has become the civilisation
of the East as of the West, then the University
whose foundation is now being laid may be the great
light of the future China.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most important part of the scheme
is that which suggests denominational hostels as the
proper solution of the difficulties that beset union and
interdenominational work in the mission field.
</p>

<p>
There are obvious difficulties in arranging for a
common religious teaching, and, on the other hand,
it is very advantageous for the many mission bodies
at work in China to show a united front against
the new materialism and the ancient superstition.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P315"></a>315}</span>
Nothing so shows the power of Christian love as a
union work of this nature.
</p>

<p>
We Christians are often taunted with our differences,
and we are assured that many will support any
scheme that makes for union and peace between the
different elements of the Christian world.  Here is a
scheme which will tend to bring Christians together,
and to induce that mutual respect and toleration
which must be the foundation of a closer union.  The
baby must walk before he runs, and if the Christians
of China can maintain such a University, their daily
intercourse will greatly assist any further scheme for
unity.
</p>

<p>
But there is another use in the hostel system
which should not be overlooked.  At all times one of
the great hindrances to the education of young men
is the tendency that they have to waste their strength
in riot and wantonness.  The Chinaman is perhaps
more subject to these temptations than the Westerner.
A student said: "We cannot work; we are too
profligate."  A Chinese statesman advised against certain
towns as possible sites for a University because of
their tendency to entice men into vicious courses.
Far the most efficient way of opposing this evil is
to make some one responsible for the moral welfare of
the young men, and this is done in the hostel system.
</p>

<p>
Every hostel would be governed by some person
who would make the moral welfare of the young men
his peculiar care and study.  The head of the hostel
might or might not be on the teaching staff of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P316"></a>316}</span>
University; but whether he taught or not, his first
duty would be the care of the moral and spiritual
welfare of those committed to his charge.  He would
give all his energy to reproduce the highest moral
tone of a Western University.
</p>

<p>
This scheme is being tried in Chentu, where a
union University is being started.  And I believe it
is in every way proving successful.  Those who have
not realised the size of China will be perhaps inclined
to ask why not unite the two schemes?  The simple
answer to those who have travelled is that the
distances are too vast.  You might as well talk of uniting
Oxford and Harvard, for those two Universities are
about as far from one another in time as Hankow
is from Chentu.  Even when the railway is built the
distances will be immense.  The enormous distances
of China are also a reason why it was impossible to
amalgamate the Hong-Kong scheme and the Oxford
and Cambridge scheme.  Hong-Kong is now ten days
to a fortnight away from Hankow, and such a different
language is spoken there that the dwellers in Northern
and Central China are often forced to use English to
understand one another.
</p>

<p>
The University of Hong-Kong will be very beneficial
to the colony, and is an example of the generosity
of the merchants and citizens of that town; but as
a means of naturalising the higher side of our
civilisation it labours under the great disadvantage of not
being either in China nor under the Chinese flag, nor
of speaking the prevailing language.

CHAPTER XXVI
</h3>

<h4>
THE NEED OF A UNIVERSITY EXPLAINED (<i>continued</i>)
</h4>

<p>
The Committees at Oxford and Cambridge had not
been without hope that the missionary world would
accept the scheme readily once it was well understood.
</p>

<p>
They had had the advantage of many interviews
with missionaries and others in London at their joint
meetings so as to make it a matter of some certainty
that a large portion of the Western educators of China
would agree with them.  But they were rather
doubtful whether the scheme would be welcomed
by the Chinese official world.
</p>

<p>
The commercial world in London that had dealings
with China was rather pessimistic.  They held the
view that you only had to mention the word Christian
or missionary to a Chinese official and it would
have the same effect that the word rats has on a
terrier.  But as I have before related, we were
agreeably surprised to find at the very outset that the
Chinese official world were far from hostile, and that
we were given, unasked, letters of introduction, whose
contents I did not know except that they procured
for us a welcome in China which was as surprising as
it was delightful.  I learnt in China that knowledge
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P318"></a>318}</span>
and learning is so loved and respected that those
whose object is its dissemination will ever find a
ready welcome, and I learnt also that whatever may
have been their sentiments in the past, in the present
the Chinese have no hatred towards Christianity, but
they regard it as one of the least odious parts of the
Western civilisation which has become for them a
necessity.  I had also the privilege of seeing His
Excellency Tong-Shao-Yi in London, and he did not
discourage the plan.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at Harbin we found an official
ready to receive us who had been sent to welcome the
scheme to China.  His instructions were to accompany
us to Kwangchangtzu and to watch over our comfort.
As he only spoke Chinese, conversation was difficult;
but with the aid of a member of the Imperial Customs
we gathered the object of his mission.  At Mukden
we met with a similar civility.  I was invited to dine
at the Yamen.  I shall always remember my drive to
that dinner.  At Mukden no carrying chairs are used,
but a springless cart, in which the traveller, or more
accurately the sufferer, reclines.  I was late for dinner,
so the order was given to the charioteer to drive quick,
and as we bounded over the unpaved streets of a
Manchurian town I had an opportunity of realising
one of the minor discomforts of Chinese missionary
life.  At the Yamen the same civility was shown to
the scheme, and next day Dr. Ross, my kindly host,
took me to see a Manchu noble of high rank.  He was
more than encouraging.  He first sounded the note
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P319"></a>319}</span>
that I found vibrating through the whole of China.
He asked why did not the West concern itself with
such things as education, which benefit man, rather
than with war, which produces such endless suffering
and misery.
</p>

<p>
At Peking I met some great officials who all were
favourable, but it was not till we got south that we
encountered what can only be described as enthusiasm
for Western education.  One gentleman advised that
such an institution should be started at once, and
recommended the recall of all students studying in
Western lands to fill its ranks.  Another who was
interpreting was not satisfied with the prudent official
reply I received that the plan was good, but that I
must make inquiries at Peking.  He added: "Make
inquiries at Peking; but if they refuse, go on with
your scheme all the same."  A body of young men
who had been educated at Boone College sent a
petition that the scheme should be forthwith undertaken,
but perhaps the most remarkable experience was that
which I had at Shanghai.  I was entertained by
thirteen of the gentry who had all received their
education in the West.  We discussed every aspect
of the plan, and when I pressed upon them that one
of the good results of the University would be that it
would have a healthy moral environment, an old man
turned to his companions and said: "We have ourselves
had experience of this.  The environment in which we
lived when we were in the West was different from
that in which we found ourselves when we returned
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P320"></a>320}</span>
to Shanghai, and did not it largely affect our
lives?"  After we had talked some time the question was put
plainly to them: "Would they support such a
University?"  One of them turned round and said: "Of
course we should.  It is obvious that if you will give
us in China the same sort of University as there is in
England, if only on the score of expense, we shall
want to send our sons there; besides which no one
likes parting from their children and leaving them in
a distant land."
</p>

<p>
I discussed the matter with a Chinese statesman in
Peking.  I asked whether Peking would not be a good
centre, but he was very adverse to the idea, because he
said that Peking had such a bad moral tone that boys
would not be able to do any good work, and that he
himself far preferred that Chinese boys should be sent
at ten years old to England to receive their whole
education in our country.  When we pointed out to
him how, except in the case of a few rich men, such
a course would be quite impossible, he said: "Then
put your University right away in the western hills
out of reach of the immoral influences of a
town."  There can be few more eloquent testimonies to the
necessity of another University; nothing but a
Christian University could succeed in creating the
moral atmosphere, which this wise man saw was the
power of the West.  In the same conversation he
gave a further testimony to the power of Christianity,
all the more striking that it was uttered by
a man who was not a Christian.  He said: "Yes,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P321"></a>321}</span>
I have no doubt that all that is good in the West
comes from Christianity."
</p>

<p>
All the officials we interviewed always ended
their encomiums on the suggested scheme by a saving
clause to the effect that, before we did anything, we
must ask his Excellency Chang-Chih-Tung.  When
we passed through Peking the first time we failed to
see him, and it was therefore with some anxiety I
sought an interview with him on our return journey.
</p>

<p>
Chang was a figure in the politics of China whose
importance it would be hard to over-estimate.  Not
that he had the reputation for being a peculiarly able
man; in fact, some of the Europeans spoke slightingly
of his mentality.  His force and influence came rather
from his moral qualities.  He was the perfect type of
Confucian scholar.
</p>

<p>
Wonderfully well versed in all the knowledge of
the literati of China, he was far from despising any
form of knowledge; in fact, he was one of the first of
the statesmen of China to recognise the importance
of Western education.  When we were discussing
with some leading merchants the want of integrity of
many of the officials, they claimed Chang as an
exception with enthusiasm.  He had held the highest
offices and still remained comparatively poor.  His
reputation for clean-handedness was enhanced by his
age.  In China the old are greatly reverenced, and
an old, honest, and learned statesman combined three
of the qualities most admired in China.
</p>

<p>
It was therefore with some trepidation that I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P322"></a>322}</span>
found myself going to see a man whose moral
authority was so great that he could with a word mar or
make the University scheme as far as the power of
the Chinese officials extended, and in his case this
was very far.  I was alone, for owing to the rather
heated debates that divided the British and Chinese
Governments over the Canton-Wuchang Railway, it
was thought advisable that no member of the
Legation should come with me.  I drove down to the
north end of the city, and turning down a by-lane,
scarcely wide enough for the carriage to pass, we drew
up opposite a very modest dwelling.  I was received
by His Excellency's nephew, a man of extremely courtly
manners; and as he conducted me across the yard I
was struck by the simplicity of the house.  The
room, for instance, into which I was ushered had a
brick floor, and was separated from the courtyard
only by a paper and wood screen.  Imagine what the
intense cold must be in a Peking winter when the
thermometer is somewhere below zero!  The
furniture of the room was equally simple.  Two Chinese
chairs of the Chinese guest-room pattern, standing
on each side of the usual Chinese table, were
supported on the other side of the room by a token of
the ever-encroaching West in the shape of a common
round table and some mongrel-looking stools, which
looked as if they were productions of Japan palmed
off as European.
</p>

<p>
As we sat and talked (for I was too early for my
interview) my host told me all about his uncle's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P323"></a>323}</span>
family, and the while I wondered at the austerity of
the dwelling of the greatest man in China after those
of royal blood.
</p>

<p>
His Excellency was then ready to receive me, and
we adjourned to another equally simple room where
the usual table with tea, sweetmeats, and wine was
laid out.  Chang during the whole interview smoked
a long pipe, which required all the efforts of what I
took to be two boys, but who really were slave-girls,
to keep alight.  He wanted to know where the money
was to come from.  I assured him that there are
many generous people in England and America who,
desiring to leave a good name behind them, and
convinced that education confers on humanity incalculable
benefits, are willing to give largely to such a cause.
</p>

<p>
Then he inquired what line we should take with
regard to Confucian learning; I said Christianity and
Confucianism need not be opposed, and we should
respect and encourage the teaching of the sage.  He
clearly approved, and gave me advice as to the course
of study to be followed&mdash;first, Chinese letters, then
foreign languages; and he advised as the site for
the University some place near Wuchang and not Peking.
</p>

<p>
He then assured me that I might tell my countrymen
that he approved of the scheme.  "Who," said
he, "could but approve of such a scheme?"
</p>

<p>
As I left he accompanied me across the courtyard,
though I protested, and I felt I had been honoured
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P324"></a>324}</span>
by this interview with one of China's greatest men.
He was the embodiment of all that was fine in China.
He belonged to an age that is passing away.  The
Chinese statesman of the future will learn Western
luxury with Western knowledge.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
</h3>

<h4>
CONCLUSION
</h4>

<p>
One word in conclusion.  I have tried to show the
greatness of the crisis that is before us.  The
civilisation which has long been worn by the white man
alone is now being donned by the yellow man, not
as the result only of missionary effort, but as the
result of those great world causes over which puny
mankind has no control; and I have tried to show
that all that we can do is to recognise and frankly
accept this great fact, namely, that the members of
the human race who are subject to and governed by
our civilisation are to be nearly doubled, and that the
second half will import into that civilisation not only
new traditions, but a new racial personality, which
must cause a fundamental alteration in many of its
traditions and customs.  We must not say that the
movement will be shortly completed, for it has scarcely
yet begun; but we have seen enough in the success
that has attended the movement both in Japan and
in China, to convince us that it will ultimately
dominate the Far East.  This movement may be for good
or for evil; it may be for the downfall of the world,
for the perpetual misery of mankind, if that which
is evil in both civilisations is to be perpetuated and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P326"></a>326}</span>
that which is good is to be destroyed; or it may
be for the benefit of mankind if, when the Christian
civilisation welcomes the great yellow races, it accepts
from them, as it has accepted from many other races,
their characteristic virtues.  Hitherto our civilisation
has grown richer; every race it has conquered
has added beauty to its traditions and nobility to
its ideals.  We may look forward with hope, if not
with confidence, to its future.  But if this momentous
change in the history of the world is to be well
directed, it can only be done by men of sincere
Christian faith; and if the civilisation is to augment these
benefits to mankind, it can only be by being more fully
endued with the Christian ethics on which its whole
greatness depends.
</p>

<p>
For the perpetuation of this ethic, for the
education of the future thinkers of China, we suggest a
University is needed; that University should not be
founded by one race alone.  Some may differ from
us, and hold that other action is advisable.  They
may be right, but it behoves them to formulate their
policy, because one thing seems certain&mdash;that a policy
of inaction at the present moment is one which is
fraught with risk, if not with disaster.  If no one
makes any effort to direct the thought of this vast
unit of mankind into the right paths, it is
improbable that good will naturally result.  The fitting of
Western thought to an Oriental race, while it must
be chiefly left to the race itself, needs clearly the
help of those who are conversant with the best aspects
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P327"></a>327}</span>
of that Western thought and of its history.  The
missionary has done much, but he himself is the first
to say, "I cannot do all; I must be supported by
those who will teach my converts the fulness of
Western knowledge."  And so the missionaries have
inaugurated a policy of education which is most
successful as far as it has gone.  The question before
all well-wishers of China is, shall it go further; shall
we show China the intellectual light by which we
are walking, or shall we leave China to stumble in
the darkness till she falls into deeper error.
</p>

<p>
Those who look forward to progress in this world
must also look forward to breaking up the old evil
traditions and to founding new ones; the old tradition,
which limited love to citizens of the same State,
which put bounds on charity, so that man did not
love man unless he spoke the same language, or at
least had the same coloured skin, is dying fast though
it is dying hard.  A new tradition is being founded,
and must be further developed, in which, as in the
parable of the Good Samaritan, the word love is
taught as passing and transcending all bounds of race
and language.  The cultivation of this new tradition
is vital to the existence of our civilisation.  If
love cannot bind races together, the improved arts
of war will in time extinguish the civilisation that
gave them birth.  If we are to encourage international
love, we can best do it by sharing together in
international acts of mercy and generosity.  The great
Chinese race has need of the wealth of Western
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P328"></a>328}</span>
knowledge.  Let Western races join together to give
them what they need, and in so doing they will not
merely benefit China, though as China counts for
a quarter of the population of this world, and is
nearly equal to the number of men who have a right
to call themselves civilised, that were no small merit;
but they will do more, for they will by common acts
of mercy and love bind each to each so that the
horrid curse of racial hatred shall not be again able
to divide them.  The elements of good in one race
will be brought in contact with the similar elements
in another race; men will learn to trust men; and
that which the thundering cannon can never compel,
or the keenest wit of statesmen ever compass, will
be accomplished by the obedience and simple faith
of the Christian men and women of all races, and
the world will be welded into one solid piece, where
men can work without wasting their efforts in making
machines to torture and kill their fellow-men, and
where at last the prophecy shall be fulfilled: "They
shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their
spears into pruning-hooks."

APPENDIX

<h4>
WILL RUSSIA BE REPRESENTED ON THE MISSION FIELD?
</h4>

<p>
When it was settled that we should go to China to see
what opportunities there were there for an educational
mission emanating from our English Universities, we
decided to go <i>viâ</i> Siberia, and stop at St. Petersburg and also
at Irkutsk on the way.  I had previously found the journey
of fifteen days without a break exhausting to myself and still
more so to my wife who accompanied me.  The plan had
also the advantage that it gave me an opportunity of trying
to find out why the great Russian Church had never attempted
any serious mission work in China.  From a mere
inspection of the map one would naturally have expected that
the Christian power which had a frontier with China of
thousands and thousands of miles would have been the
most forward in that country in fulfilling the command of
the founder of Christianity to give His message of
happiness to every living man.  In our previous tour we had
been surprised to find that the missionary efforts of Russia
were insignificant in China, though, strange to say, they
were fairly vigorous in Japan.  When we arrived at
St. Petersburg I was fortunate enough to obtain letters of
introduction to the courteous gentleman who then
represented the imperial power in the councils of the Russian
Church, M. Iwolsky, Procurator of the Holy Synod.  One
thing became evident; for the time being Russia is so
much absorbed in politics as to be oblivious of other duties.
Living in England, we can little realise the excitement and
anxiety that filled the minds of many who dwelt in the far
off villages of Russia, while they waited to hear whether or
not they were to be engulfed in a revolution as dangerous
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P330"></a>330}</span>
and as far-reaching as that which more than a hundred
years ago overwhelmed France.
</p>

<p>
A lady described to me how she had sat in terror in
her country house when all communication from St. Petersburg
had ceased owing to the strikes, while the smoke of
surrounding houses which had been set on fire by marauding
bands told of the fate which might possibly await her.
Now all that is over.  The revolution&mdash;so they think in
Russia&mdash;is a thing of the past; and Russia has entered on
a course of conservative reform to which, if she adheres,
will doubtless make her a prosperous and contented empire.
</p>

<p>
I gathered from some of my informants that the reasons
why Russia had been backward in the mission field, and
also why she was racked with revolution, were in reality
the same, namely, that the Orthodox Church was not so
vigorous and had not that hold on the consciences of the
people that it ought to have.  Not that for one moment
Russia is ceasing to be religious.  The attendance at Father
John's funeral was quoted as disproving such a possibility.
People of the working and middle classes came for miles
to stand on a bleak cold day for long hours merely to catch
a glimpse of the coffin which contained the mortal remains
of a man who, according to their belief, lived more than
any man in accordance with God's law.  Russia is religious
to the very core; but, like all religious nations, our own
included, she longs to express her deep sincerity through
diversity and not through uniformity.  Alas! there are
people in every nation who want to put us in one religious
uniform and to march us like soldiers at the word of
command straight into heaven's gate.  In England this view only
makes some good and narrow-minded people anxious to
have such a thing as religious uniformity in our schools;
but in Russia this doctrine has been more vigorously held,
and is doubtless responsible for the waning power of the
Orthodox Church.  Mr. Pobiedonosteff, leader of the
reactionary movement, nearly caused a revolution, and certainly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P331"></a>331}</span>
weakened the Church, by insisting on Uniformity and
Orthodoxy.  He believed that there could be but one form
of religion in the State, and therefore he discouraged every
other form of religious activity.  Not only did he rightly
forbid those strange wild immoral sects who practise and
teach mutilation, but even the sober and devout followers
of Lord Radstock were to be silenced.  The result of such
a policy was but too obvious.  Religion was made odious
by the insincerity which such a policy must foster, and the
State became detestable to all earnest Christians who claimed
the inherent right of every living soul to love and worship
his Creator in accordance with his true convictions.
</p>

<p>
All this has now passed like a bad dream.  People in
Russia may believe what they like and worship God how
they like.  M. Iwolsky was most anxious that the world
should know that he, the then representative of temporal
power in the councils of the Russian Church, so far from
encouraging the idea that Christ's Church can be
controlled by a temporal power, however great, was most
careful to maintain that in spiritual matters the Church is
independent of the State, even if in temporal matters she
submit herself to the authority of Government.  Peter the
Great abolished the Patriarchate; he added many, though
not all, of the powers of the Patriarchate to the Crown; and
therefore the Emperor represents the Patriarch in many
ways.  But it is wholly misunderstanding his position to
say that in spiritual matters he is supreme.  The Russian
Church, like all other branches of the Church, is controlled
and governed by councils, both general and provincial.
</p>

<p>
But M. Iwolsky had to confess that the power which
the State wielded in the Synod of the Church was still
very great.  The Crown has three ways in which it can
influence the council.  First, though the members of the
council are representatives of the Church, it is the Crown
who decides (with the exception of the Metropolitans)
who those representatives shall be; secondly, the Crown,
through the Procurator, can forbid any action which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P332"></a>332}</span>
brings the Synod into conflict with the laws of the State;
lastly, the Procurator, as representative of the Crown,
must always be present at the debates of the Synod, and
has always a right to express his opinion, even on spiritual
questions.  Such powers put together clearly give the
Crown a control not only in things temporal, but, if it is
desired, an influence in things spiritual as well.  Still it
cannot be too widely known that at any rate in theory
the Russian Church is in things spiritual independent of
temporal power.  Most Englishmen would think, no doubt,
that if the Church is to hold her rightful place in the
hearts of Russians, she can only do it by relying on the
power of preaching rather than on the power of the sword.
Therefore it would be best for both Church and State if
they had less to do with one another.  English Churchmen
will be glad to hear that there is some prospect of a Synod
of the Orthodox Church being held, independently of the
existing Holy Synod&mdash;a council which may rank as a General
Synod of the Greek Communion, if other branches of the
Orthodox Church are invited to join in its deliberations, of
which there is some prospect.  The object of this Synod
will be to reform the discipline of the Church, a matter
which is engaging, I understand, the sincere attention of
the devout Christians of Russia.  Few things bear truer
witness to the weakness of the Church in Russia than the
low moral tone which exists, as all witnesses aver, in every
grade of Russian social life.  The outward observance of
the fasts and feasts and ceremonies of the Church, though
admirable in itself, is perfectly consistent with a great deal
of scepticism with regard to the truths of Christianity.  It
is not uncharitable to suspect such scepticism when a great
profession of Christianity is accompanied by a low moral
tone.  The Church has felt her weakness and has sought
the help of the State, and has therefore not succeeded in
her mission.
</p>

<p>
Now happier days have opened for Russia which it is
hoped may lead on to happier ones beyond.  The State no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P333"></a>333}</span>
longer helps the Church by silencing her critics, by exiling
those who cannot agree with her: the Buddhist who lately
at the definite command of the Government had accepted
Christianity has returned to sincerity and open profession
of Buddhism.  The Church no longer so supported by the
State may feel her weakness, but she will grow rather than
diminish in strength as she learns to use more and more
the real weapon of Christianity, namely, the sacred truths
of our religion published both by writing and by preaching.
Russia is one of the great nations of the world.  The
Orthodox Church which dominates Russia is both true and
faithful, and she will guide her people into prosperity and
peace when she has learned to follow her Master's example
and to order the sword drawn in her defence to be returned
altogether to its sheath.
</p>

<p>
Nothing can be at present expected from the unorthodox
bodies who until lately have been persecuted to such a
degree that they have scarcely been able to exist.  In
external matters the Orthodox Church commands the
obedience of the nation to a wonderful degree, but in
controlling the deep convictions of the heart she lacks
power.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in the moral
tone which prevails in Russian society.  Perhaps it is not
just or fair to take the capital of Siberia as a specimen of
ordinary moral life in Russia, but one might well say at
Irkutsk that all save the spirit of man is divine.  We had
been to a certain extent prepared by our previous tour to
disbelieve in the horrors of the climate of Siberia, but what
we saw and heard at Irkutsk has convinced me that Siberia
should rank high among the places that are reckoned
pleasant for human habitation.  Siberia, or certainly the
eastern part of Siberia, is not the dreary plain, wind-swept
and miserable, that one read of in one's childhood.  On the
contrary, it is a land of constant calms and steady sunshine,
a land of lakes and hills, and though it is cold, the cold
seems but trifling in the glorious sunshine of a Siberian
winter.  I feel certain that if Lake Baikal were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P334"></a>334}</span>
somewhere within reach of London it would be one of the most
frequented centres for pleasure-seekers.  And from the
point of view of wealth it is a most favoured land; a land
where there is gold and where there is coal; a land where
there is copper and silver, and where a hot summer ripens
thoroughly all cereal crops.  For sportsmen it seems a
veritable paradise.  The pheasant (or at least his brother)
with whom we have long been conversant as dying of every
disease in the moist coverts of England, lives wild in this
dry and healthy climate.  The wild boar and the wolf, the
bear and many forms of the antelope and deer, are to be
found on the borders between Siberia and China.  The
rivers are full of salmon and other fish whose names I
cannot attempt to give.
</p>

<p>
If an Englishman were asked to choose whether he
would live in St. Petersburg or in exile at Irkutsk, he would,
I believe, have no doubt in deciding in favour of the latter,
if&mdash;and that is a great if&mdash;the spirit of man were not
so human and corrupt.  We were told that there are six
hundred women who are divorced in the jurisdiction of
Irkutsk.  Such a statement indeed seems incredible, but
certainly the morals of the officers leave much to be desired.
Vices go in flocks, therefore laziness perhaps accounts for
the amazing state of things which exists in Irkutsk.  The
town is as full of officers as Eton is of boys.  Epaulettes
jostle you in the streets, you tumble over swords in the
restaurants, and with all this force at the disposal of the
authorities&mdash;for I conclude that some at least of these
officers have soldiers under them&mdash;the streets of Irkutsk are
unsafe after dark.  Person after person warned us of the
danger of being unarmed at night, at any rate in the
by-streets.  People are murdered in their own houses in the
suburbs; women have their fur coats torn off their backs.
One is aghast at the incredible slackness of the authorities,
who instead of instituting a reasonable police force such as
exists even in Chinese cities, allow the city to be watched
at night by aged Dogberrys in huge fur coats armed with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P335"></a>335}</span>
rattles which they use incessantly.  Certainly, though they
may fail to frighten away robbers with this primitive weapon
of protection, they succeed in interrupting the slumbers of
the visitor.  In the department of municipal activity the town
is equally badly organised.  The streets were under snow,
and as upon a hard-seated sledge we leapt from hole to
hole, we had at least the comfort of realising that in summer
their condition must be even more trying.
</p>

<p>
It is unsafe to trust gossip, but I give it for what it is
worth.  We were assured that the only reason why the
priceless wealth which Russia possesses in the gold mines
of Siberia was not further developed was because of a
similar official incompetence.  There is said to be a great
deal of secret digging for gold.  Men disappear in the
summer and reappear in the autumn with a pound's weight
of pure gold, for the gold lies only about three metres below
the ground.  But if this primitive form of mining came to
the knowledge of the Government it would put in force the
mining laws which would then successfully stifle the industry.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to add that profligacy and laziness are
not the only vices against which Russian Christianity has
to contend.  Their people have another in common with
ourselves of which the Church is only too well aware and
which it is making great efforts to suppress, namely,
drunkenness.  Actually on our journey we had an example
of this vice which every one regarded as comic, but which
might have been tragic.  The train is brought suddenly to a
standstill.  There is something wrong.  Everybody tumbles
out of the carriage to look.  A man is lying in the snow.  At
first it is thought he has been knocked down by a previous
train.  Further examination shows that it is only a man
dead drunk lying right across the line&mdash;the result of
keeping one of the festivals of the Church.  Every one
laughs; he is pulled out of the way, we climb back into the
train, leaving him in the care of a priest, quite unconscious
how near he has been to death.  Drunkenness is a terrible
evil in our own land, but its results are far more terrible in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P336"></a>336}</span>
this land of frost-bite.  There are numbers of people
without hands and feet begging in the street, and we were told
that the general cause of these injuries was vodka.  A
man going home falls into a drunken sleep on the way: he
awakes next morning with his hands and feet frost-bitten,
or perhaps he never wakes again: the sleep of drunkenness
merges into the sleep of death.
</p>

<p>
As one considers these things one realises why the
Buddhist Bouriat and the Mohammedan Tartar still adhere
to their ancient faiths.
</p>

<p>
I do not think an Englishman has a right to criticise
other nations when so much remains to be done at home.
Still one cannot truthfully say that, however numerous her
churches or well-attended her services, the Orthodox Church
directs Russia while she is powerless to make headway
against these vices.
</p>

<p>
The great trials through which Russia has passed hold
out every reason to hope that with liberty, purity of worship
will be again established, and where there is purity of faith
there must be mission work.  No doubt the Government
has hindered mission work; in fact, they have forbidden it
in China.  Christianity was to them so much the handmaid
of the State as to be inconceivable outside the State;
but all this is breaking down.  The great mission work
conducted in Japan to which I have before referred has
shown that the Orthodox Church grows well on Eastern
soil.  The existence of a village preserving the Orthodox
religion in the middle of China which has been spoken of
above, has demonstrated at least the vitality of that faith
among the Chinese nation.  When the Russian missionaries
cross the frontier they will not leave their own country
weaker, but their work will be a token that Russia is
purifying her faith and is advancing along the road that
leads to holiness.
